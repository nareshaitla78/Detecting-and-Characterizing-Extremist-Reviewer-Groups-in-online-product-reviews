2,__label1__,Lithium batteries are something new introduced in the market there average developing cost is relatively high but Stallion doesn't compromise on quality and provides us with the best at a low cost.<br />There are so many in built technical assistants that act like a sensor in their particular forté. The battery keeps my phone charged up and it works at every voltage and a high voltage is never risked.
3,__label1__,"I purchased this swing for my baby. She is 6 months now and has pretty much out grown it. It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money."
4,__label1__,I was looking for an inexpensive desk calcolatur and here it is. It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5,__label1__,"I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth."
6,__label1__,I'm not sure what this is supposed to be but I would recommend that you do a little more research into the culture of using pipes if you plan on giving this as a gift or using it yourself.
7,__label1__,"Pleased with ping pong table. 11 year old and 13 year old having a blast, plus lots of family entertainment too. Plus better than kids sitting on video games all day. A friend put it together. I do believe that was a challenge, but nothing they could not handle"
8,__label1__,"Great vitamin C serum... I really like the oil feeling, not too sticky. I used it last week on some of my recent bug bites and it helps heal the skin faster than normal."
9,__label1__,"I've used tide pods laundry detergent for many years,its such a great detergent to use having a nice scent and leaver the cloths smelling fresh."
10,__label1__,"Everybody wants to fall for their promises. But this is a relatively unheard of brand, some even say a non existant company. Look at how amateur their labels and products are. You have to ask yourself if you would trust this kind of amateur stuff? No way! Don't waste your money."
11,__label1__,Unfortunately they didn't work for me. They made me sick and throw up once of the two times I tried them
12,__label1__,"This kettle is a gift for my daughter. She said that it is easy to use. She likes the design of it, so nice and neat."
13,__label1__,"I love this tumbler! Keeps drinks warm or cold for a good period of time, and its very sturdy. I get complements on how sleek it looks all the time, especially because it doesnt leave fingerprints. Highly recommend. Only suggestion when washing the lid, be sure to shake it and dry well to prevent dripping when the lid is on the tumbler."
14,__label1__,"Only giving this 3 stars because it is so cheap. Has a very mild sedative effect, other than that it's pretty useless for stress/anxiety/panic attacks. Save your money ad get some ZenRx. Night and day difference.[[ASIN:B00HBGBRY4 ZenRx - Dietary supplement reduces symptoms of anxiety, stress, depression, and panic attacks.

15,__label1__,"I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen."
16,__label1__,wonderful headphones had them now for 5 months and works great also great price and the sound is very clear and loud and soft the the ears love my headphones not to mention that they are sony
17,__label1__,"Video quality if superb, fits just fine, looks like a real mirror (I believe they enhanced this), my only gripe is I wish they put the cameras not side by side, but one on one side, the other on the other side. I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far."
18,__label1__,"As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip."
19,__label1__,"just to be fair, i really believe that this is a great slicer , and the idea was there, but unfortunately there are tricks when using this spiral slicer, i mean manual or something would have been helpful.<br /><br />I'm not saying something negative about this slicer because it does work, but however it did it took me almost a week in trying to learn how to use this slicer in cutting different kinds of vegetable.<br />the price i may say is fair, but i do wish that there were manuals in every box in showing us how to use this slicer properly."
20,__label1__,These tablets are especially helpful if you use the Secure dental adhesive.<br />I bought this stuff for my father. and he was satisfied with this.
21,__label1__,Looking decent as same shown in photos Thank You amazon .I saved cost as paint of this type is very costly and as this is digitally print looking decent.
22,__label1__,"I find that the older I get, the harder it is to lose weight....but I've gotten great results taking garcinia this month. I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time."
23,__label1__,"I have had my camera for about 2 weeks now. The pictures are great, it is so easy to use. I love it!!"
24,__label1__,"It is highly recommended not to buy this product.  I took the suggested dosage for a week and felt nothing, no extra energy, no loss of appetite, no pounds lost."
25,__label1__,"The actual power supply is good, but the cable harness's had to be completely taken apart and re-oriented to avoid a birds nest of backwards wiring in tower. It's like they didn't test it to see if it works."
26,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food."
27,__label1__,I love the fact that you can easily read the measurements...great for those of us who's eyes aren't what they use to be LOL. I get so tired of trying to read the numbers on those others where it's the same color as the cup itself.
28,__label1__,I have bought several products from this seller and I have been pleased with all of them. The green coffee does exactly what it says it does! I am happy with it and will purchase another once I am finished with this bottle.
29,__label1__,"This is an extremely well made electric blanket. We tried 2 before this one & took both back. You cannot feel the wires and the material is very luxurious. I did feel it was quite pricey...about $50 more than the ones we took back. However, that being said, the quality indicates it will last for years."
30,__label1__,great product for coffee lover that want little more rich flavor on their coffee. Love that is easy to clean.
31,__label1__,I figured it would for sure fit a dasani bottle.... it doesn't.  I have been able to use it with cheap water bottles though.
32,__label1__,"This dinnerware set provides a very nice aesthetic. It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer."
33,__label1__,The sides of the case didn't match my phone at all but the real issue is when the tan color became blackish in some parts. Looks unpleasant and can't use like that.
34,__label1__,"Since I have a low pain tolerance this facial hair remover didn't hurt very much. It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz, especially when wearing foundation. The tweezers were okay, loved the color but it was a little hard for me to use. Wish the package was bubble wrapped because it was so cute but mine got smashed in the process of shipping. Great customer service!!"
35,__label1__,The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture. The picture shows a lot and describes how much it holds. I found it hard to accommodate my D3100 and two lenses along with the battery charger.
36,__label1__,Bought this to use with my gel eyeliner. The handle is longer than I liked but it works well. I like that it is slanted and very easy to apply and clean.
37,__label1__,"This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :("
38,__label1__,I used this in my photoshoot last month.. It's really cool.. it has a nice built quality and vintage look.. really awesome..
39,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!"
40,__label1__,No go. All the reviews are fake. Buyer be ware. I took it and I got blood in my stool. Stopped taking it right away. Look all the reviews are positive with the same thing to say. Same reviewer. If anyone really took it as i did you would write a 1 star review because no-one wants blood in their stool.
41,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a ""fat burner"" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)"
42,__label1__,i have read in many reviews that calcium hampers the burning of fat. But i am taking this since october. I am losing lbs. So i dont really care what it contains as long as it keeps me fit and going.
43,__label1__,Worked as expected and very cheap. It's very lightweight and durable and the length is just perfect for me and my wife. Although we still have 3 spare stylus pens we don't know what to use for.
44,__label1__,"My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />""So, tell me what it cant heal?"" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help."
45,__label1__,It is a true recommendable product which works great on my skin. I take a pill daily with a tall glass of water. It is the best way to restore and refresh the skin from within. My skin looks softer and like it has a glow after using this.
46,__label1__,"Shower curtain is a little thinner than I would like but it works just fine (for the price) with a liner behind it. Also, the darker color is almost too dark --I added some towels and s rugs of different shades of it to bring out the colors...looks nice!"
47,__label1__,I'd like to have a decent speaker set I can use for my dorm room and this is what I got for my budget and it's surprisingly good! The sound is very clear even when set to max volume and bass is decent. Perfect for me and my roommate and for some slumber party. It looks pretty conventional too. I was looking for something rather stylish.
48,__label1__,I don’t really care either way for the scent or appearance. It’s the part where it cleans that I needed.
49,__label1__,Searched all over for a large dutch oven. It's great for browning or carmalizing meat and with its large high grease does not splatter all over my stove. I also love it's ability to transfer it to the oven for roasting or braising. Great for soups. Easy cleanup.
50,__label1__,I had high hopes for a thickening shampoo instead it left me with less hair then before and I feel like it accelerated my hair loss further. I will not continue using it and will return the remainder for a refund
51,__label1__,"I have begun using many of the techniques discussed in this book to help deal with my anxiety and depression. It has been a huge help!

52,__label1__,This art paper was exactly what I was looking for and made a great present for my younger brother who really loves to draw anything. It was also a great price!
53,__label1__,"The only down side is that i find they are not air tight not good for brown sugar; chips and crackers go stale. My crackers took on the ""taste"" of the container as well. Seem to be fine for my pasta, rice, or cereal that gets eaten quickly."
54,__label1__,"There is no question about the goodness of the camera. The product is as good as a new one (except for the warranty time). I trust this brand and if it's inspected and reconditioned from the factory, I rest my faith in it."
55,__label1__,"Love this case, it's very sleek and slides into your pocket perfectly. Every now and then my phone falls and it has protected it from those mishaps."
56,__label1__,"3 month ago, I found I have recently lost more hair than I used to be every time during shampooing my hair.  I have a thick hair but it seems looked a bit thinner now.Since then, I have been taking any steps that I can possibly to make my hair grow. And i know this product by my friend. After 2 weeks using, my hair has grown rapidly. I've gone from crying over my hair, to being pretty excited about it."
57,__label1__,"This is a nice stylus although I prefer the 'SERENE STYLUS PEN"" due to its small (4mm)nib tip for less screen obstruction. Its also very comfortable featuring its silicone grip. Check it out at  [...]"
58,__label1__,"I bought this camera for its night vision which I have found to be very poor, if you are using this camera in low light it works well however in total darkness it doesn't work at all. I was also using night vision booster LEDs and it still did not work in total darkness."

60,__label1__,It is very helpful to keep the car cool for kids and protect them from heat of the sun while we travel.Easy to attach to the car windows and it really stuck there.
61,__label1__,Useless Christmas gift. Kept on trying to use it on different fabrics with no luck. Produces steam but not enough to do anything. Useless.

63,__label1__,"Pen Drive is very good in this budget, it works faster and no any problem yet, delivery was very fast."
64,__label1__,"The product actually helped out in a lot of areas, particularly where my workout performance is concerned. But I was expecting it to burn fat. Maybe my research was wrong?"
65,__label1__,This is a SMOKING HOT deal. This is the second unit in the last 2-3 weeks They work when you first plug them in but watch out. Somewhere between 1-5 charge cycles these things get so hot you can't touch them. Then they pop and smoke.....game over. No more charging.   The only reason I am giving this a 1 star is the returns have been easy. Reading all of the reviews it looks like about 1 in 3 are good chargers. I'm going to step up and pay the $$$$ for a real one this time.  Don't want to risk burning down the house over a $30 difference between junk and genuine Apple product. Yes it sucks but get yourself the real deal here http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008ALAAV0
66,__label1__,It really does work. I have been taking these for a month and a half and I have lost about 7 pounds. I am so happy that it works and that I have lost weight. I wanted to give it time before I wrote my review but it is totally worth trying!
67,__label1__,"I am a brown skin young lady who likes the look of a tan. I had a trip plan to Miami. Not wanting to sit outside in the damaging sun for long periods, I thought I would help my tan by using this product. For three days I used this product following the directions exactly as stated. This product did not work. My skin does not have any hint of a tan."
68,__label1__,"This is a fun little gadget to use and I'm a happy camper. It works great and as described. I found the short videos easier to understand than the instructions on the accompanied manual, but you don't need any of those to know how to operate this thing. Very pleased with the tool, however I wish they included a few more recipes."
69,__label1__,"When I made this purchase, I thought it was a expensive. But, it looked exactly like what I had in my mind. I was pleasantly shocked when it turned out to be high grade metal construction. It turned out to be an ornamental piece on my desk. There is no doubt in my mind: This will last a lifetime and look good doing it."
70,__label1__,"$50 for some stinky tablets. Nothing, nada, no effect whatsoever. It's taking me awhile to write a review because I was trying to give them time to work. It wasn't until I landed up in the hospital (Not Because Of This Product) that I realized I blew 50 bucks. The Doc asked me all that I was taking and I gladly told him about this product thinking maybe it was the cause of my hospital stay (It was pneumonia) He and the nurse both sensed my fear and promptly me told me they were just glorified vitamins with big cheesy smiles on their faces. OH THE SHAME!!!!"
71,__label1__,"It of high quality and matched the exact product description. The camera might be a big tough for beginning digital photographers, but it's wonderful for me. I was familiar with most of the features but the instruction manual taught me several new things I could do."
72,__label1__,I really felt like this product did absolutely nothing n I took it for two months. I'm kinda disappointed. :(
73,__label1__,honestly skip the hand pump and get a real motorized one... yes they are expensive but have tremendous value.
74,__label1__,"I am always struggling with my weight. At college I lost the battle. I joined a Fraternity and from there on I gained 32 pounds. It's mostly due to fast food, and beer.<br /><br />I DECIDED to get back on track. I started to run, and do some hitting on a speed bag. With Garcinia Cambogia my appetite dropped and I don't eat as much as I used to.  So far I've lost 6-7 pounds."
75,__label1__,"This company sent me a email after i purchased this on eBay and asked me to review the product on amazon.  They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure."
76,__label1__,"I'm not really sold on the flavor and texture of the contents. When a rather lazy roommate served this, it was a night of hilarity which involved some food throwing. Still, it might just me who is too picky."
77,__label1__,"I am a coffee drinker and considered a pod machine but what the heck, just one cup? I studied the reviews and decided to go with this one. Have no problem with the plastic smell that some have mentioned. Two small negatives that I do have are the display is not lit and can not see in dim light and the sight gage is on the wrong side for the position I have it on the counter, but I can live with these, it makes a great cup of coffee."
78,__label1__,i love the necklace but in order to use them you really need to accessorize and the necklace is really good if you have accessories that can match up to it.<br /><br />it is just fortunate that I have some gothic looking items that can enhance the beauty of this item.
79,__label1__,I recently bought this item and the case did not last more than a week.  I should give it more stars but I cannot.  But for the price.  I guess you can't complain!
80,__label1__,"My 19 month old loves these videos, especially the shapes DVD for some reason. She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch."
81,__label1__,Used it in the last few days. It is well made and appears to have high strength and<br />does its job well.

83,__label1__,"I love it. It fits really well in the driver's seat. I'm not used to driving long distances that's why I ordered this one for back support. I tried it first on my computer chair and it really feels comfortable. I like the material of the cover made too. It's soft and very nice material. I tried it on the driver's seat as well and it's perfect. It helps me relaxed my back don't need to actually pull the driver's seat forward. I think I made a great decision in buying this Lumbar cushion. The only thing that I'm worried is the durability of this cushion. I think it's good if you don't use it too much because I feel like it's not hard enough not to sag after couple years. I hope I'm wrong. But you know what, it's perfect for the present and for probably the coming whole year."
84,__label1__,Goes on thick but absorbs well and leaves my skin smooth and soft with a light scent of cucumber. a little goes a long way and too much can feel greasy so start with just a dab or two.

90,__label1__,This organizer arrived today and as soon as I opened the box I was completely DISAPPOINTED at how cheap it looked. I would have rated it NO STARS if I could have.

98,__label1__,"I enjoy taking a nap when I get home from work. This product not only helps me sleep better, but does so in a way that wont ruin my makeup. The shape of the eyes makes it so that it doesn't even touch your eyelids, so your eye make-up will survive the nap. My only issue with the mask is that light seeps in a bit around the nose."
99,__label1__,"It was so poorly made that it was damaged in getting delivered, twice. I had to keep the second one because my son was going to camp and we needed it right away. Looks nice and rolls nice, but eh box is made of a thin material and rivets were missing and dents. A quality footlocker would have withstood the shipping."
100,__label1__,"I haven't been taking it for very long but I'm excited by the simplicity of the ingredients list!  The capsules are labelled as &#34;Veggie Capsules&#34; which is slightly confusing because no where does it list what exactly is in the pills, just &#34;Forskolin Blend&#34; which...could really be anything.

Thank heavens! I take one pill in the morning and another in the evening.  I am not sure if I will ever stop taking these, they help so much.  I do take the brain teasers online as well and that seems to help with my brain function as well."

108,__label1__,it was exactly what I was looking for and the price was very good and I would recommend it to everyone thank you
109,__label1__,Much more difficult to use any regular ice tray. The circles don't always come out circular and there's only four cubes in one tray which isn't nearly enough. Even though they give two trays they are still somewhat difficult to use. They banned a lot and are hard to fill with water
110,__label1__,I love these bedsheets. I thought all I ordered was the fitted but actually got the whole set! The price was very reasonable the quality is great. This is the second set I have used and have been happy. Will order another one so I have three sets. I only use this even during the summer months.
111,__label1__,I got this from my best friend. we tried it and at first you would really love the smell. its soooo yummy.  YOu will want to lick it off your face. but dont!. I don't find it to be as effective as it says. I've put it on for about 4 times now.  dont see any change really. But i do love the smell.
112,__label1__,I really enjoy the scent of this Rosemary oil. It isn't super strong but it does the job. I keep it around for late nights and early mornings. Perks me right up so I can get through.
113,__label1__,"Was pretty cheap and works just fine. Holds a good bit of video and pictures, which I needed. I'm a blogger. Formatted fine with my camera and was compatible for my computer. Mac Book Pro."
114,__label1__,"We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too."

118,__label1__,"I'm enjoying my very first Perlier purchase! It's working well and the 99% Shea will last me a long time. I just scrape a little off, let it melt in my hands, and smooth over dry elbows and heals. It doesn't quite last a full day for me, but close!"
119,__label1__,"There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby."

125,__label1__,Best rake I ever had. Seems durable. Its quite light weight which makes me feel that i'm gonna break the rake.
126,__label1__,Children LOVE these bands and have made a lot of really cool different bracelet patterns using them. the tye dye bands make each creation unique because they are not a uniform color.
127,__label1__,"The color of the bag is absolutely amazing! The inside of the bag(lining) had a very strange smell, it was almost fishy. I was very disappointed and was ready to send it back. I turned the bag inside out for a night and the smell has disappeared."

135,__label1__,"I bought this for a shower gift, and cannot believe the quality of this product.  The color of the trim and the actual bumper does not match at all.  In addition, the image show raised dot design, and the actual product is flat, I feel cheated.  The zipper bag is broken, I will have to return this since it's not presentable at all as a gift item."
136,__label1__,I've been really pleased with this product since purchasing a few weeks ago. I can feel a difference on my skin and it's helped with my acne and blemishes. I also like the pumice stone for my feet.

However, when I tried VITA RESTORE it maxed out these products. My hair thickened and shines. I've also grown hair for about 2 inches in length which is really great. The dandruff that my previous cream causes now disappeared. And my nails look healthier and growing fast... This is truly one of the best remedies I tried. It's cheaper too!"

So I returned them before the return policy ran out, and moved to another Brand. After trying a few models Skull candy makes, I decided they were not for me."

Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start!

156,__label1__,"I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies."

After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out."

171,__label1__,I bought this as a gift for my sister in law and she loves it. She does the gel nail polish and loves that she can fit all her fingers in at once. Her old dryer only did one finger at a time. I don't know the long term quality but her initial reaction and her use for a couple of weeks is all positive.

For a long time I began to let those things slip away because I was constantly in pain and aching. Adding a natural supplement to nurture my problems has been a huge relief.<br /><br />Even more effective than the cosaminDS by itself has been combining it with higher levels of glucosamine, chondroitin, and cissus powder: [[ASIN:B009ZP5ERA Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM Blend w/ White Willow Bark 750 mg (60 Capsules) + FREE Cissus Joint Powder 100 Grams]]. The blend of those supplements has alleviated all my major aches and complaints as well as made me less stiff after sleep or sitting for prolonged periods of time. I can make it up my front steps without growling in pain."
174,__label1__,"I was surprised at how well packaged these tables were. The quality was great for the price; the color was exactly as advertised. They came all put together, they are nice and well worth the money. They are exactly what I wanted."
175,__label1__,"The mold is really nice. I tried one of my grandmother recipes and it come out fabulous. I was a bit worried that it would stick, because the recipe doesn't have oil in it, but I have to say that the silicone pan is great and the loaf didn't stick at all. the size is a bit smaller than a normal loaf pan but its so much more stylish."
176,__label1__,"I received this in record time, and it smells great! It isn't overpowering, like some brands, and the oily feeling isn't slippery or greasy--which is the sign of a really good quality essential oil. I like that it comes with a glass dropper that actually goes to the bottom of the bottle. At the moment I type this, it's making my headache go away."
177,__label1__,I purchased this product about a month ago and have loved the results. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in suppressing their appetite and losing weight.
178,__label1__,Great for a one time use. This is not something that you would use over and over again. However for 5 dollars you can use it once. It is very high quality and you do not have to worry about buying something expensive that you will never use agian.
179,__label1__,"Junk! Only people who like it are probably paid for it. We had 2 weeks of complete frustration. It did not go off when it should, and went off when it shouldn't. The funny noises that &#34;rotate&#34; were a nuisance. We gave up and got something for less than half this things price, and that worked well."

181,__label1__,"It is a Multi Function color laser printer, scanner and dual sided printing/scanning. If you do not need this last option there are printers about HALF the size and weight. I'd go for it but my parents sometimes need the dual sided function.<br /><br />Well, it's a good printer for Office use. Do not even think on printing resolution pics on it, it does not output well, specially with other kinds of papers.<br /><br />Be also aware of the &#34;dial&#34; that keeps warning you to change toners when you don't need. Just look on youtube for videos on how to reset the toner counter on the side dial."
182,__label1__,"This is a great jar, it holds up well and it has no leakage at all. However, ensure to tighten the spout if you plan on filling it up all the way to the top. I got the jar to brew kombucha and so far its serving the purpose just fine."
183,__label1__,It absorbs quickly and completely and leaves skin oh so smooooth but the smell of the lotion doesn't suite me.  I would love it if this also came in a variety pack with nice smell. I also ordered the Bay laurel foot and leg lotion and found it to be just as great. I will be ordering more of this as the weather cools.
184,__label1__,It is hard to control the phone through the plastic.<br /><br />I have to get it out to access the app then put it back in..the armband itself however is comfortable and the functions are excellent.
185,__label1__,"It has a good quality considering a cheap price, compared with high end goggles and more expensive ones I found it very good in terms of design and features. I recommend this brand to newbies as well as to professionals. It's a great goggles."
186,__label1__,"I have been using these for about 2 months and they worked pretty well, but not quite what I was expecting. I definitely saw some improvement though. I switched over to Phytoderm, [[ASIN:B00IT4POOG PhytoDermTM- The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides, 350mg! Clinically Proven! Facelift in a Bottle - As seen on Dr. Oz! Help Your Skin Look Younger And More Vibrant - Sells Out Fast!]] and within a few weeks I started to see what I was expecting from a phytoceramide. I am not sure what the difference is, but its worth the extra couple bucks for the 20-30% improvement. Both good products, but the phytoderm is certainly the better of the two."
187,__label1__,"I was told that fabulous benefits are gained from using Phytoceramides products such as Phytoceramides capsules, Phytoceramides for skin and Phytoceramides supplements. This product has helped me in keeping the skin smooth, getting rid of lines and wrinkles, healing damaged skin and improving the firmness of the skin and elasticity. Itchiness and redness has also been reduced after using this product. However, the results were a bit slower than what I expected."
188,__label1__,The headset has worked great in my household. I have left them on my head and realized they were working clear as a bell downstairs when I retrieved something to drink. What clarity they have! Tune them in and you're all set. I've even laid down with them and they don't turn off like others have. All the controls are on the side of the ear piece and don't get in the way of lying on side. What a great deal!
189,__label1__,It wasn't so clear as advertised when I got it and it has gotten worse over time as became brownish color. Scratches everywhere and not pleasant looking after a short time.
190,__label1__,We bought this Armoire for our 9 year old granddaughter for her birthday. This is something she should be able to use long into her adulthood. It is very well made and is very roomy. Happy with my purchase since my grand daughter is happy.

192,__label1__,"This thing makes dealing with a pineapple easy. But i suggest you buy the tall pineapples rather than the short fat ones. The unit is not adjustable, so you leave a lot behind when you do a stubby pineapple."
193,__label1__,"These are the lowest calorie bar with the highest fiber and protein ever. Plus they are so good that when Harps stopped caring them they sold out. Very tasty, not too sweet. Great for healthy snacking."
194,__label1__,"These were a bit thin for Wisconsin winters. The sheets are very soft though. If used with thick blanket, they will do."
195,__label1__,The one I received was not sharp. Used it on straight hair and it did not cut well. It tugged and pulled at the hair even though the hair was short. I guess I just got a bad one. I sent back.
196,__label1__,"Very nice sheets.Thick and comfortable. I personally hate sheets with synthetics, so these feel good. Only regret is I got burgundy, should have gotten peach."
197,__label1__,"Ok, no one tell my son this....but, I actually put this baby food (always use organic!) in his muffins.

Cleaver mommy...heehee"
198,__label1__,I was looking for trash bags that I could buy online to help save time (and possibly money) because the kind I normally get is only available in the . For the similar quantity these bags were cheaper and I was able to buy online.
199,__label1__,"The reason so many reviewers have been disappointed with this product is not because of the quality.  Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place."
200,__label1__,It didn't fit my phone tightly as I hoped which makes me uncomfortable as the sides seem to wiggle with the slide of a finger. There are better options at same price range.
201,__label1__,"This is all I needed. I am tired of paying more money for simple products that do nothing special, that is why I bought from Stalion. Simple brand that costs decent and that does everything the product ought to. This battery has a good performance and good price, which makes it a good purchase I guess. I can say I am not regretting this purchase so far."
202,__label1__,Now this is what I am talking about. I am happy and satisfied with this purchased.  I will be buying more of this.
203,__label1__,"What do the negative reviewers honestly expect from this product? From the moment I opened it, I knew that it was exactly what I had in mind. The content could be more substantial though. That's my only quip."
204,__label1__,"Exactly what I wanted. It's spacious inside and really don't take up much space on the door, fit neatly in place. Note to the manufacturer, please do a better finishing job at the corners. Made in America should be excellent...I will recommend this product."
205,__label1__,"We have the light charged, resting on counter in laundry room, ready for the next power failure. We like the handy feature of the light for certain jobs."
206,__label1__,I used this right away. Dark circles run in the family. I think I look better! :) The product makes my eyes soft.
207,__label1__,"These chairs are very inexpensive but they look good, they are comfortable. Assembly wasn't too awful. For the price, i'd say these were a good deal.."
208,__label1__,"After using lipogaine minox for a few months decided to give the shampoo a shot. Absolutely hate IT! MADE MY HAIR shed tremendously, and it smells awful.  I would advise to stay away!!! ALL REVIEWS on this shampoo seem FAKE."

210,__label1__,"I have to say, with all of the junky MacBook battery replacements out there, I had my hopes quite low when I decided to buy this instead of buying an OEM replacement one. After a good deal of research and review reading I finally made my mind and bought this Key Power's battery and to be honest, so far it has been great. It gave me about 3 hours of unplugged power after 1st charge and cycle, and has actually improved in the 2 weeks since I got it. I'm not sure how long it will last, but the 18 month warranty makes me feel comfortable. I'm glad that I took."
211,__label1__,"Every time I got a headache, I drink two of this Advil liqui gels. 1 liqui gel is not enough for me.. It's very effective though.. Gonna buy 1 box.. I get a lot of headaches these days.."
212,__label1__,"I used to use a oscillating fan to help me sleep.  But when it's cold you don't want a fan circulating air in your room all night.  For some reason the noise this machine puts out is much more soothing than an electric fan.  Just turned off a little by the price but hey, tons of people have nothing but good things to say and I am backing them up!"
213,__label1__,This item is splendid! It fit the way I needed it to and holds my Galaxy S5 and there are no worries about it dropping out. Used it for running and it held up great!<br /><br />I have bought ones that were definitely more expensive that didn't work half as well or did not go on right. Terrific item!
214,__label1__,"Cheap but Not working, come with only few accessories, Power supply not working well. the inks is useless, Don't try to use the ink and the needles for real skin tattoo or got infection.."
215,__label1__,"Pros:<br />-maintains the standard Zippo design and distinctive ""click"" sound when opened.<br />-very compact design, fits really nicely in my hand and pocket for easy carry.<br />-black matte finish is quite gorgeous. I wanted something different from the typical chrome finish and am not disappointed! The black finish also holds up well to use and handling.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-since the lighter is so small, you may find that the usage varies quite a lot from when it is full to empty on fuel. The flame can vary in height and intensity. Also, I notice the smell of unburned lighter fluid quite frequently. Refueling often becomes necessary."
216,__label1__,"Worked great although I needed to update some drivers on my PC running XP to see the card. But after four months it just died, cannot re-format. Never had it in any extreme conditions, lost all my data."
217,__label1__,"Defective, leaking.The inside hose is too small restricting water flow to about half of what I used to get from old hose. It took me a lot more time rinsing off the soap. Unless you have all the time and don't mind spending half an hour showering then don't get this hose. Save yourself the frustration."
218,__label1__,"Original Carrera is much better I think. it is a great composition - one that stands out. Impressive juice...this will not be duplicated, ever.

219,__label1__,"Assembly was pretty easy, although the provided allen wrench couldn't turn all the way around, making it a bit tedious. The glass is pretty thin, which makes me wonder about it breaking in the future, and would probably look better frosted. Overall, decent value for the money."
220,__label1__,a very useful glass i use every day in the kitchen. they are perfect for when you have some friends over and want to bring some cocktails or soda...
221,__label1__,"It's noisier than I would have preferred but it's not to a degree that I can't tolerate. Besides, the results are great and my kids always enjoy their snow cones."
222,__label1__,"XS pills work on so many levels, and I think that's due to the green coffee and tea extracts that are in them. My body has reacted really well, meaning I just feel energetic and chipper all of the time. And of course I've lost weight, too, almost 30 pounds in just under 2 months. All in all, I love everything about these. Would definitely buy again."
223,__label1__,"This works very well. I have pale fair skin and have puffy eyes with dark purple bags. I have to continue using products like this because I constantly get the bags. I discontinued use of the one I was on and did not use anything for a week. My bags were back. I started using this and you can see that it worked very fast, the puffiness was gone and the bags faded fast. They are even toned & soft"
224,__label1__,"My scalp was allergic to most color brands, over the counter and at the best salons. This is the best colorant for me haven't had that problem since. My hair is so shiny, soft and it is a beautiful color."
225,__label1__,I was shocked at the awful smell and the fact that I could not feel anything good about this product.  I used the whole bottle and it just seems to be a placebo that really does not work.<br /><br />I am switching back to my old resveratrol
226,__label1__,I ordered two pairs. They got delivered much faster than the 4-6 weeks I was expecting. I think it was only 7-10 days. They are OK headphones
227,__label1__,"When I use a product, I don't want to settle with what is just good. It has to be mind-blowingly excellent. So far, this product has only been good."
228,__label1__,"Picked this up for my daughter, she does like the color.  Haven't taken her out fishing yet with it so we'll see how it does in actual use.  But so far seems pretty decent."
229,__label1__,"Super sharp, this cut my finger once becasue I was holding it wrong. Great item, not cheap at all, has a nice weight to it unlike the other plastic ones."
230,__label1__,"It is really great! I gave it to my wife and she is really happy. Thanks to this tool, I can never be bothered seeing my wife using her bare hands applying her Eyelashes extension."
231,__label1__,"I am still learning the art of getting these molds filled correctly, but am starting to have a bit more success. I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these."
232,__label1__,These smell bad and the nifty nose piece that attempts to keep the light out doesn't do so at all.  all I can say I like about it is the little ear bud holders in the strap I think that's cool.
233,__label1__,This is the easiest way I've found so far to completely cut snacks out of your diet. Within two weeks I was able to stop everything. I'm still taking the pills though because I haven't lost any weight. We'll see how it goes.
234,__label1__,I have this case a friend actually bought it for my galaxy s4. It protects the phone very well but the sound quality isn't that great when your talking to someone. you feel like you need to put it lauder or take the case off but at the same time if you want your phone to be safe you should get this cases.
235,__label1__,What else is there to say... We have a newly installed vinyl floor in our kitchen and didn't want any indents or markings from our chairs. These are easy to install and keep my chairs sliding easily across my floor and leave no dents or marks on the surface.
236,__label1__,A nice rapid charging case that is compact and does not add too much bulk. You will get about 2 full charges out of this case which will easily get you through 1.5 days of moderate to heavy usage. It works with iphone 6 4.7&#34; model only not to be used with iphone 6 plus 5.5&#34; model. Easy way to tell battery life by pressing metallic button on the bank once and pressing again to turn off to stop from wasting battery of the case.
237,__label1__,Scratches like crazy and the sides discolored quickly. My main issue is that I have dropped my phone from 3-4 feet and the bottom side of my phone is dented. I can't believe it got dented through the case.
238,__label1__,"very good quality, as with all products from luminarc. I find the plain design interesting and more useful than having a highly decorated one. A good deal too as i bought them when teh were on sale."
239,__label1__,"These pillows tend to be comfortable, We have these currently intended for couple of weeks and so i don't believe it has been even a 30 days since i own these, they tend to be fine if you ask me. The stiffness is actually good however I can point out to people that it is a brand new wedge pillow and so i do not recognize how lengthy would in which stiffness would last."
240,__label1__,"The watch is good, and half a month to evaluate it.. Function is very full, then call, send and receive text messages, as long as the phone can receive messages including QQ micro channel, etc. can be pushed to the watch, but can not back. Note2, Android 4.3 perfect compatible! Beyond the expected watches and mobile phones can actually connected via the Internet, this just can't pick up the phone can send and receive text messages, push missed calls and all mobile phone to receive the news."
241,__label1__,Love taking this product right before my workouts. I have noticed improvement in my strength and would recommend to anyone looking to lose weight.
242,__label1__,I haven't activated it yet bit I did try to enter some info in it and i found it to be very fast and sooo sensitive. the only thing i question is how difficult it is for me to enter numbers...maybe i just have fat fingers.
243,__label1__,"The counter stool is great for the price, and the fact that it is available immediately is a big plus. Most stores we went to required a few weeks to prepare. The wood has a nice smooth polish to it, the stands are very stable, and they look great in our kitchen. However there is one drawback that I have noticed. After only 2 months of use, the cushion has started to basically wear out thin. Not noticeable from the outside, but when you sit on it, you can feel the nails and wooden frame underneath. Not really comfortable after say 10-15 minutes."
244,__label1__,"its a great read, facts to be read is just so shocking and the same time amazing, Love it, I just love it...."
245,__label1__,"It's perfect size for purse or travel. It comes in a little spray pump bottle with a lid. It has no smell, oily, it dries quickly and it's sticky. I hate having to  wait for hand sanitizer to dry. Great for people on the go. Excellent shipping time."
246,__label1__,I have friends and family who purchased nearly exactly the same spa and paid twice as much for it. I really did my homework and shopped around and you guys definitely had the best prices. I love this spa! It has all the features I was looking for and the quality is fantastic. Setup was easy breezy beautiful!
247,__label1__,"Great face mask of minerals from dead sea. Shipped with prime. It gives a burning/tingling sensation for a lil while when u apply, but the skin feels soft and fresh after. All natural cleanser and exfoliator. Came with an ebook which you can download online, havent looked at that much though."
248,__label1__,"Libro que parece haberse escrito bastante aprisa sin detenerse mucho a profundizar en los personajes. El escritor vuelve sobre el socorrido tema de Cuba, aunque no presenta nada novedoso. Los lectores no hallaran aqui algo que ya no se haya dicho antes en otras novelas."

251,__label1__,"This chair is quite durable. I bought it for my daughter's room and she is happy with it. The seat and back are very fluffy and comfortable. The only thing I'm not happy about, is the color. I bought the blue since my daughter's bedroom walls are painted a very light blue, like the color shown online for this chair. If the chair color actually looked like the one in the online photo, it would be perfect. But it is a much darker blue than it is shown and I was very disappointed with that..."
252,__label1__,"I recently began a new fitness program that put a pounding on my 55 year old joints. I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene – Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene."
253,__label1__,This is great for things like axes or other utility blades but you should forget about using this for your kitchen knives.
254,__label1__,I can't iron fast on a blanket.<br />Lucky that my mom gave me the old ironing board that she had before.<br />It was not new but looks like it's not.<br />Thanks to my gorgeous mom who gave this!
255,__label1__,"Great fun. I bought these for my kids, and they had a great time making designs on their own nails, and playing salon. The free refill offer is excellent. Nice product."
256,__label1__,Great stuff.  This mud mask is not only fun to use but feels great.  It definitely made my pores look smaller and made my skin feel firmer.  It was easy to put on (for a mud mask) and felt fine while it was on.  I would recommend using it maybe once a week or so.  My grandkids thought it was hilarious too!!
257,__label1__,"To put in few simple words. If you like Buffett or if you want to learn more about him , then buy this book now :)"
258,__label1__,"Ahhh!! Im so happy to have found just blue jolly ranchers.  Like someone else stated, there never seems to be enough blue in a bag of mixed flavors.  And all my friends fight over the blue ones. lol  I just wish the price wasn't as high as it is.  But ill pay it to have my blues"
259,__label1__,its not a bright blue as you would expect. Its a dark green rather..But still a nice color.Does get smudgy after a while..
260,__label1__,This is so hard to do. But it works.<br /><br />If you want to look great you have to work at it. This program directs you how. And for that I will pay the price because it is a lot more cheap than hiring a trainer.
261,__label1__,I like it to shower with. The fragrance does quickly disappear. The bottle is only nice for appearance. I really like the honey moisturizing. that's it that's all.
262,__label1__,This clock is exactly what I was looking for and fits my space perfectly. Thus far it has kept great time and looks good over the mantle
263,__label1__,"I don't really know what I was expecting when we got this. I thought that at least my toy pooch wouldn't bark or growl as much for no reason. Throughout the time that we spent on trying this however, her barking didn't let up one bit. She still barks even when the neighbor's car slams at night."
264,__label1__,"Okay, on my part I would give it 4 stars reasoning being that its lid is not fine with those soft vegetables. However, with carrots, it's just as it has been illustrated in the photos which is what made me purchase it. That is a minor issue and wouldn't be fair not recommending it to anyone and they can be ready to make some salad which is delicious and quite appealing to the eyes"
265,__label1__,"These are real than the screen, like my friend. Exquisite craft and realize the value of the funds is truly wonderful."
266,__label1__,"This is a unique concept compared to a lot of other teething products. There are plenty of really awesome necklaces that are baby safe for chewing and I utilize them a lot- [[ASIN:B00E7OXN22 Pendant Baby Teething Necklace - Non-Toxic Jewelry for Mom, Safe for Babies to Tug, Touch, and Chew! - Buy 1 Get 1 FREE!]]. It's a super convenient way to keep the teething toys with you at all times without worrying about them falling on the floor or getting thrown if you're out shopping etc.<br /><br />What makes this particular piece unique is that from a distance, you'd think it was actually jewelry. It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all. It's great to know there's something I don't have to be embarrassed about if I forget to set it aside (we've all been there- puke on shirts...you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines."
267,__label1__,Just built my friend a new office computer with this chip and very happy with the build. Chip runs cool and does everything that she needs including graphics editing and excel spreadsheets.
268,__label1__,My dog won't take these. Dogs usually know when there is not good product. Is it really dasuquin in these tablets?
269,__label1__,"I like the unit and once running it does everything expected. However, it does not like to be hurried when first starting. You need to turn it on and leave it alone or it gets locked up. Gets very annoying when trying to watch a new movie. Once started however it works great."
270,__label1__,This pressure oven does a superb job on roasting turkey and chicken. They come out moist and tasty in a short period of time.The feature doesn't work to well though. The rod becomes disconnected when the oven heats up under pressure and of cores it quits turning and even fell out once. If you cook without pressure it stays in place but takes longer and you loose the moistness.
271,__label1__,"Went for the price but no major regrets. The light has to be placed at the right place without too much obstruction/ objects around. Can cover only a small area, around half a tennis court. The cord is also a bit short. All complaints were made by my son, who used it for his indoor party. I on the other hand am very content with it for the purpose that I bought it for."
272,__label1__,I really love this Gold Plated flatware. It is sooo beautiful. I do wish you would see if you can manufacture some matching ice tea spoons. Then the set would be perfect.
273,__label1__,"The design on this is a lot more prominent than I expected. And although it's very thick and sturdy, it's also light as a feather, which is great. I like how it doesn't look like your typical yoga mat bag."
274,__label1__,The quality of this bathrobe does not nearly come close to what was advertised especially considering the high price. I can get one just as thick in any one of the inexpensive chain stores. I just touched the fabric and was very disappointed. Returned it without opening it at all.
275,__label1__,To be honest I was a little dissappointed with this game. I bought it becuase the store had a good deal on it and I decided to give it a shot.  I think this game has some glitches that should have been worked out before release. But I haven't had some of the problems other reviewers here are saying is in the game. If these glitches were worked out I'd give it five stars. I just don't think it's as bad as some people are saying.
276,__label1__,"Had to send the first one back. The release mechanism was defective. No hassle returns policy, ordered the second one, but had to settle for another color...OK, the new one worked fine. Great size."
277,__label1__,This product was weak and barley gave me the extra kick I was looking for to increase workout performance. This product may work well for people that are sensitive to stimulants or new to supplements.
278,__label1__,What I particularly find useful is the topic on app security. The author really did a great job in explaining the engine behind external app authentication using OAuth and S2s high-trusts.
279,__label1__,"When the light turned on, it looks good! Unfortunately, the music does not work!<br />One end of a two-lane, if you do not want the music to a separate, possibly during transport. If you happen I can not give five stars!"
280,__label1__,I was surprised at how big this toy is. The assembly took a little over an hour and the girls were helping as much as they could. They were very excited and have spent a lot of time playing with it with their barbies.
281,__label1__,It's a nice case for the price. It is easy to slip on. It protects the phone by creating about a 2mm gap between the case and the phone. It also has about a 2mm lip over the front to protect the screen if you drop it. But I'm a little disappointed with the color cause it's slightly brighter pink than the picture shows. I was hoping for a peachy pink and it is a little brighter than that.
282,__label1__,"The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />""Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...""<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series."
283,__label1__,"I think this product works as described but it lasts not very long at all, maybe a couple hours of increased focus and alertness but that is it.  For the price I would expect this to last all day or at least most of the day. At this rate I would need to reorder a new bottle every 2 1/2 weeks.  I'm sorry but I can't afford to do that."
284,__label1__,"This is a toy not a medical product. It stopped working in just 1 day, the silly trumpets don't sound anymore. I'll just count it as money in trash. It's an absolutely useless product. No wonder it's priced at 30 bucks."
285,__label1__,Good enough for the outdoors if it was right in front of you.  You hear the mosquitoes get zapped.  its disgusting cleaning it though.  I guess you could always get  a new one.
286,__label1__,"The lack of physical activity caused me to have cellulites on both my thighs and legs, I've done lots of exercise to get rid of them but none of them worked. I had told by a friend of mine that cellulite cream with retinol and caffeine will work and so I ordered this product, two weeks after using it on a regular basis and I have seen a significant improvement. This product is what I'm looking for!"
287,__label1__,"good price, quality is okay, but for the price is good enough,will buy few more as gift for my friends"
288,__label1__,This is exactly what I was looking for. Prevented my phone from breaking after couple of drops also.
289,__label1__,I don't know why but after seeing the images and reading this I felt like I wanted to hurl really bad. It was especially annoying since I just ate some excellent sushi and I was not about to waste a good salmon roll.
290,__label1__,"This is definitely worth the minimal time and effort. Just one pill a half hour before your meals and boom. You're losing weight and feeling better inside and out every day. At least thats the hope. For me it worked, I actually have a friend who bought them at the same time as me who hasnt had the results Ive had.. Not sure the deal but I can't be happier with what's happening with me."
291,__label1__,"We needed a second one (I have twin boys and they could share one when they were really young, but not anymore) and this one is a great buy for the money. All the features of Pack n Play - easy set-up, etc. for under my budget. You can hardly find one second-hand for that amount."
292,__label1__,"This bracelet is gorgeous, but I found it so uncomfortable. I don't have large wrists, but my wrist bones do kind of stick out. No matter were I placed the cuff, it was hitting my wrist bones. I had to return it."
293,__label1__,I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha
294,__label1__,"I feel some stinging in my teeth every time I use this product. And I know it really works though, because I’ve seen my teeth get a lot whiter. Overall I’m happy with this, and have no major complaints."
295,__label1__,"I use this product to steam clean our curtains, my daughter's stuffed animals/throw pillows when I can't or don't have time to wash them. Easy to use. It's easy enough to use but it tends to get a little heavy when doing larger jobs but that would be the case with any appliance."
296,__label1__,"Once again, dealing with them was a pleasure. It is a handsome and functional wallet, well made from high-quality materials. I expect it to give years of good service."
297,__label1__,"Perhaps it's because I'm surrounded with a dense miasma of collective pop culture references all day, but I found The Goldfinch quite captivating. It's good to suspend the more intense inclinations of the mind and simply allow it to be submerged in the story. On the other hand, I can understand the disappointment that some might feel if they think that the quality did not meet their expectations."
298,__label1__,Really like these candles. Gave 2 for gifts and kept one for myself. Elegant looking and works great. Enjoying the timer option and fact that I can put in a location you would never be able to put a real candle. Put inside TV stand and adds to decor.
299,__label1__,"The instruction page very easy to follow and understand. The fact this is waterproof is a major plus, as we do get rain and showers during the months my vegetable garden is planted and grown. I am just really happy that the squirrels and skunks don't beat me to my garden grown vegetables, and I would highly recommend this item."
300,__label1__,I never thought I would ever pay as much as $20 for a travel mug. But I really got tired of making coffee in the morning and having it be lukewarm by the time I got to work. This mug is the perfect solution. Overall a well-made product that I hope to enjoy for a long time.
301,__label1__,"The display is large enough to read from across the room, even in daylight. So far it is very accurate and is happy it has a built in battery for backup, as we sometimes get momentary power hits."
302,__label1__,"I decided to spend a few extra bucks for the peace of mind of knowing this thing was going to work without hassle. Once again, ASUS didn't let me down. Put in my i7-3770k and everything started up with no problems."
303,__label1__,I have wanted this watch for a long time now and finally made my purchase. I didn't like that you can't really see the LED outside in sunlight. It's OK when's the sun goes down or if you're in a nightclub. I won't return it because of the cheap price and it makes a good conversational piece.
304,__label1__,Nice watch for my friend's kid. I received it on time and in an excellent condition. Kids like it. I would recommend this as a good item to gift someone especially kids.
305,__label1__,"i like how minimalist this stand is, it doesnt take up much space and it looks very classy as well. One thing i hate about it though is that its difficult to adjust the inclination, its because the stand its self doesnt hold especially when you have a glass table."
306,__label1__,This is actually comfortable and not at all like my last helmet which was incredibly distracting whenever my husband and I would go out cycling.
307,__label1__,The unit worked fine initially. However from day 2 on the signal drops every 20 minutes. I have to power cycle either the transmitter or receiver to get the units synced up again.
308,__label1__,"This is my second Brita pitcher. The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it."
309,__label1__,"Delicious candies, it comes very well packed, so the taste of each kind of candy was good. My only complaint is that after I purchased them, I found the same package for a better price by several dollars."
310,__label1__,I love the Yoda design but not the functionality of this bottle. But was disappointed because it leaked after several use.
311,__label1__,"I was looking this with first interest buy this ... I can not buy this because I do not trust it. Please check the pictures, and the company website. This is not for Sprint Samsung GalaxyS3 4200mAh is not showing there. From where is this information?"
312,__label1__,"This brush isn't bad for getting through tangles, although it does stick a little when you have thicker hair. When wet, it seems to be more difficult to use. All around, the brushes are pretty decent for use on your hair."
313,__label1__,"I like this product. I am in my mid twenties and really do not have any wrinkles, but I noticed that this does perk my eyes up a little and it is a great preventative for wrinkles. I trust the OZ Naturals brand!"
314,__label1__,PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS NOT A CYBERPOWER RB1280X2D REPLACEMENT BATTERY. USE OF THIS PRODUCT MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND MANUFACTURER WARRANTY.
315,__label1__,"love this dslr, it fits my EF & EFS line of lenses.. The versatile lens helps a lot for low and high angle shots.. less heavy compared with the 7D.."
316,__label1__,"I'm enjoying swimming more often now compared before, i hate latex and I'll never wear one again. Silicone is the thing because it's comfortable to use, doesn't wear out easily and it's cheaper. This cap is durable and very good at keep my hair dry, I love the style as well and the toughness of the silicone. I'll be recommending it to my friends!"
317,__label1__,I carry it around with me and jot down every idea that pops into my mind whenever something comes in that I dont want to forget. Ive been able to start two small (grass roots) businesses that have come up from nothing with all ideas written down in this notebook. Thanks!
318,__label1__,Definitely does the trick I have a few friend who swear by this stuff. I'm not a big fan of the taste though
319,__label1__,"If you are going to use it for playing Counter Strike Global Offensive, like me, you can just go ahead and buy this right now!"
320,__label1__,"This is an awesome baby monitor IF you keep it plugged in constantly, it doesn't last very long off the charger and if you shut it off the monitor, you may as well just plug it in cuz if you turn it back on, it's dead. But sound quality and everything is wonderful."
321,__label1__,"I use the Pro-A Serum every other day. I apply  about a dime sized amount to my face and neck after completely washing and drying my face. It has no smell at all. It is a thicker serum, almost gel like. It absorbs well into my face and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I love the results I am getting from the Pro-A serum. My skin is tighter and more firm. It feels softer and more moisturized then it has in a long time. My lines and wrinkles are going away, and I just feel younger, knowing that my face looks better."
322,__label1__,"I had high hopes when I saw that this one was of the bestselling solar panels here. I read most of the reviews here, and decided to purchase one for my house. Once they arrived, I managed to install them and for the first day I didn't had any problem - only thing was that I noticed that panels were of low quality and fragile. Second day the charge controller broke for no apparent reason, I just saw it broken and since I couldn't fix it myself -I called support - which, by the way, was not helpful. I returned the panels and asked for a refund, because they didn't wrote in the description how fragile these were :/.<br /><br />I listened to my friend's advice, who's a solar repairman, and I bought, like he did, a Suntastic Charger ( http://amzn.to/1Ad27Vf ) which I received 4 days ago. It's strange how I never experienced any problem with these - the material was good and firm - and charger was much more practical than of the Renogy."
323,__label1__,i love this product . bec i love to video something that is hidden and this product works perfectly for me but i hope i could video more. and have a higher memory . :)
324,__label1__,I used it once.It is not 100% pure and a good quality as they said.It contains mostly water and alcohol.
325,__label1__,These are all over my house. They work for any size room and are completely mess free. Great price for a quality product.
326,__label1__,its a beard growther! little bit confused but found that is cool to use . Thinking to take this one for me.
327,__label1__,"I used this with no problem, issues, didn't drop it, etc the day before then went to use it yesterday and it will not turn on. It just literally died. They said they have no warranty. So after only 6 months of very infrequent use, just died. Would not buy again without a warranty from a company that offered one."
328,__label1__,"I wouldn't recommend this baby seat to anyone who wants a safety to his kid. Once I got it, I put it into my car, because I had to drive my kid to the kindergarten, and once I arrived, the buckle just stuck - for no apparent reason. After a 3 minute fight I managed to free my kid from a seat and it was a disappointing experience. It happened 4-5 times after, so in the end I called support and asked them for help. They didn't had concrete solution, so I returned the item and got a refund.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I bought 65LX Seat ( http://amzn.to/1xthVzA ), because a colleague who had a 6 yr old kid said he bought it too and never had any problem with it. Once I got it - a week ago - I never had any problems with buckles, and since it had positive reviews here I wondered why I didn't purchase it prior to this one."
329,__label1__,"Each luggage is perfect for everyone in my family. It is big enough and everything we need can fit on it. It is perfect for everyday get-outs or out-of-town trips. The only thing that I don't like about it is the wheels because they don't seem to be durable. I have this for 2 months already but I still don't trust the wheels. They look as if they will be broken for some time. But aside from that, everything is good already."
330,__label1__,They went out of stock in the stores nearby over night. Getting it online is the best thing to do if you don't mind waiting a little. Perfect combination of product and price too...my grandson is going to go ballistic!
331,__label1__,"I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!"
332,__label1__,I just love how this makes my skin feel and how it feels around my eyes .I don't have lines at all but there's nothing wrong with trying new products .
333,__label1__,"This is a very nice shower curtain rod. The color is a nice dark brown color. The only issue that I would caution is that the finish is painted on, and does scratch if you are not careful with your hooks/slides."
334,__label1__,"I lost only 4 lbs in a month with this caralluma, I will be switching back to garcinia cambogia, garcinia seems to work better for me."
335,__label1__,"This peel is like a facial in a bottle. It is effective yet gentle. Very easy to use and gives great results. My face has a wonderful glow immediately after using this peel. A little goes a long way, too. An excellent in home peel!"
336,__label1__,"This is a good product. I have been using it exclusively for 6 months or so and saw some solid weight loss. (3-4lbs a month) I have since switched over to a product called LipoPhen which seems to work much better, and I am now seeing 7-8lbs of fat loss per month. If you are a looking for a really intense fat burner/appetite suppressant, I would check out LipoPhen [[ASIN:B00I8ULAD0 LipoPhen - Advanced Weight Loss Supplement]] or LipoDream [[ASIN:B00I8US55G LipoDream - Non-Stimulant Advanced Weight Loss Supplement and Sleep Aid]]."
337,__label1__,I'm really enjoying having a smaller hand held cheese grater. It's much easier to clean and use then my older stand up grater. I use this to grate cheese right on top of homemade pizza and salads instead of having to use the larger grater and a bowl or a plate. I also love that it is dishwasher safe and comes with a storage pouch so I don't cut my hands on it when it's in my utensil drawer.
338,__label1__,"Good quality USB cable, such as a color change indication can tell at a glance if the full load management, but also a very reasonable price, I will have a time when they do so."
339,__label1__,fairly acceptable. shaves but not as close as i'd hoped for no matter how many times i go over the area.
340,__label1__,too small! i'm only using it for my face but i hate the idea that it is too small. it doesnt smell anything bad and i actually like the feeling of it. after 3 usage with me and my wife it change texture rather quickly. i also bought another one (circular charcoal) and it degenerates rather quickly.
341,__label1__,I really enjoy using camera and the convenience of the strap for hands free. Met all my expectations and then some. Has all the features I was looking for and at a price I could afford.
342,__label1__,"Used the serum for a month and like it a lot so decided to try the eye cream too. Like how you can save a few dollars by buying the set. The serum goes on silky smooth, absorbs well and not greasy. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized all day long. Can notice an improvement in the wrinkles too. The eye cream is very nice too. Soft and absorbs nicely into my skin. Skin around my eye area looks brighter and less wrinkly. Going to buy again."
343,__label1__,There is nothing fancy about these envelopes. They are very basic but that is all that you'll need. They have the right format for most letters and are not that expensive.
344,__label1__,"Good Product. Deep Inside, Nice & Stylish Outside!!. amazon Delivery is also very Quick. Good product @ decent Price"
345,__label1__,"This lasted a bit longer than the crackle bone I think simply because it is round.  It is made form light weight plastic and very easy to eat.  My girl and 11 month old puppy was able to eat this in under 10 minutes.  I was hoping it was harder plastic like the normal kong toys but not so.  If you have a chewer - don't waste the money.<br /><br />If your pup doesn't chew and just plays then I would say go for it.  But, if they are a chewer - they will eat it in short order."
346,__label1__,"The powder certainly smelled sweet and vanilla-like but I wouldn't describe it as a vanilla milkshake.  The fake sugar taste was really really apparent so possibly the plain variety would be better.  Although the company was really nice to send me a sample, I was disappointed and wouldn't order this."
347,__label1__,These heads do not vibrate any where near as strong as the original Philips Sonicare heads.  Not worth the savings as I had to go buy a brand name repalcement from Walmart after trying these.
348,__label1__,"The build of the bottle as a whole  is pretty solid. However, there were a few places, specifically the juicer parts where flash plastic got in the way of using the product. The build is solid and it feels good in the hand!"
349,__label1__,"This piece of junk stopped spinning exactly in the middle of me starting to smile. I mean, whoa, did this thing really just stop working just as I was enjoying the breeze? That's just rude man."
350,__label1__,"I enjoyed this towel holder, especially good for the design if your in to it like I am, it doesn't hold the really heavy towels but does the job."
351,__label1__,Love the softness of these sheets. They are so comfortable. These are a great buy for yourself or as a gift.
352,__label1__,Fantastic price for such a lovely artificial tree. This makes a great addition the ones already in my house. This tree is my new favorite!
353,__label1__,"The cooking surface is very small and the cleaning is next to impossible. If you don't attempt to clean it while its hot, you may as well throw it away. There is no temperature setting either so it cooks everything fast or it will leave burn marks on your food. I so wanted to like this product because I wanted to eat healthier but this product doesn't live up to expectations."
354,__label1__,"I have been using other expensive brands but came across this brand while shopping on Amazon, wish I had not made that huge mistake for falling for the reviews & cheap price. Within few minutes of applying this on my face my whole face broke out I mean major break out & my face turned all red and hot it's been a week now and I can still see patches of red dry skin on my face and forehead. I am absolutely positive that this is not pure argan oil , it is either mixed with sunflower oil or cut with other cheap mineral oils, I have never had this bad experience before with pure argan oil and I have been using argan oil for 2+ years now, the only time my skin would have a reaction or break out is if anything had either sesame oil or coconut oil in it or when the products contained mineral oils. We also noticed that this oil very thin compared to other expensive brands and my husband is researching this product and is trying to find a local lab so we can send this bottle to be tested to see what all stuff this oil contains."
355,__label1__,"The quality of this set of crochet hooks does not compare to previous purchases of individual hooks. I purchase an I-9 crochet hook from a crafts store pre-2000 and the quality was great. These are acceptable, but not the same. Still usable though."

357,__label1__,"I love Omega 3 supplement but the fish aftertaste is why I stop taking them.  When I saw that these didn't have a fish after taste I was excited until I discovered it did.  It is a mild after taste, not as bad as most I have tried before.  I would recommend these if you can handle the after taste."
358,__label1__,"But this is just far too narrow. It's recommended that one should lie diagonally on a Mayan hammock but this isn't possible with this hammock. I will be returning this and then buying a ""family"" size hammock for $49 from another firm."
359,__label1__,We just bought this watch for one of my sons birthday gifts and he LOVES it. I am incredibly happy with the quality and this definitely gains the cool points with him. My husband also has this watch and wears it on weekends and it's been going strong and taking the beating of my outdoors man for a couple years now.
360,__label1__,"I've really enjoyed using this treatment from the moment it was delivered. Easy to apply, smells really nice, doesn't leave my hair feeling heavy or slimy despite the oils in it—in general, this treatment turned out to be perfect for me.

363,__label1__,I bought this hoping i would get a day out of my battery or that maybe I could use it as a swap battery on long trips. Unfortunately the clips on the case broke on the first use. I was careful placing it in but the materials used for the case seem really cheap. I don't know about the battery yet but it won't be very useful without a case that stays on the phone.
364,__label1__,I originally bought this hairband for my daughter but when it arrived on my mail and opened. I like it and tried it myself and was happy putting it on my hair so I guess I will order more of this for myself. One for my daughter and one for myself.
365,__label1__,Installed it easily on my phone 6 days ago. It doesn't need a manual to put into the phone and looks appealing. I am not sure about hard drops at this stage but seems to work very well with soft drops on the TV stand and bedside stool. Nice one..

The sound quality is the weakest link.

It makes delicious hot coffee in 30 seconds. You can leave the coffee pod empty and it makes a hot cup of water for tea. I've also used this product to warm up baby bottles instead of boiling water. I've used my keurig at least 3 times a day for over 2 years and haven't had one problem yet. The price is high for a coffee maker, but it literally last forever. I highly recommend this product."

I don't know if I already got a noticeable lighter skin with this lotion, I don't notice much because I am not so focused on checking skin changes. But overall, this is really a good lotion."
379,__label1__,"I found that this eye cream irritated my eyes slightly. I think it's because it's currently winter where I live, and the climate is very cold and dry, making my eyes extra sensitive and my skin much dryer that normal. I think that caffeine in this product irritated my already sensitive eyes a bit. I normally don't have any issues with Passport to Organics products, and I have found the Zinc Eye Cream to be wonderful and very moisturizing for the winter. I look forward to giving Caffeine Eye Cream another try in the summer when my eyes are less sensitive!"

388,__label1__,The new spigen nexus 5 ultra hybrid case is a nice durable case. I like how I can change up the design of the case whenever I want. It's super easy too. The case is not too flimsy. I took off one star became I feel like the back plastic can easily get scratched. But we'll see about that. I've only had for two days so we'll see.
389,__label1__,Very interesting material but not a book that really grabbed me. Perhaps its because its not the usual kind of book I read.
390,__label1__,This is the great product.Its collar is really awesome. It is made of high quality of materials with great price. So really I loved it. The case is also dirt and shockproof.So I am confident that my iPad is more protected now. A very fantastic all-in-one case that I recommend to everyone.

392,__label1__,"I was somewhat disappointed. The bag was not as thick or as padded as I would have liked. It serves the purpose, but lacks some useful features. More padding and more pockets or dividers would have been appreciated. Still, it is a good price and gets the job done."
393,__label1__,"I'm not sure these do much. I'm pretty sure they don't hurt anything, and it's possible my appetite was suppressed a little bit, but did not notice much of a difference in energy or weight loss. Might be better combined with other supplements for best results."
394,__label1__,Excellent quality and versatile product. You don't have to think twice about it. More vibrant in person.
395,__label1__,I really like the look of this box. My apartment is really small and I am looking for a neat way to keep things under my bed so that it stays out of the way and I can retrieve it when necessary. My concern is that I am not sure how tall this box is and I only have about 5 inches under my bed. I don't know why this product doesn't mention the height...

397,__label1__,"The scent is amazing if you use just the right amount. The only problem is that for it to last all day when I'm at work I have to really spray a lot of it on and it's too much for a couple of hours but after I get to work the scent will taper off.<br /><br />I work in an office environment and the first day I wore it like 100 people asked me about it which is nice, but I could tell it was strong. I guess other brands are kind of the same but I think this one is like that because of the way its made and the scent even though it is amazing!"
398,__label1__,Worth the extra few bucks because it's really good quality. The cutouts are neat and the case fits the S4 well. I only wish it came with a screen protector.

401,__label1__,"I really enjoy this camera, I take it where ever I go, it takes great pictures. And I make all my videos for my business with it. The only problem I just began to have is the battery life is not lasting like it did at the beginning, so what I am doing is constantly changing the brand of batteries to use."
402,__label1__,"Seems to perform just ok, it's a battery. Came packed well, easy to put in my Note 3, doesn't look used..it's a smidge more than batteries that say their OEM, but besides the label, there doesn't seem to be a difference."

407,__label1__,SMells really bad! Almost like rancid and old underwear.<br /><br />Do not purchase this. I can't tell if it is good on my skin or not because I can't bear the smell to even use it.
408,__label1__,I bought one of these a while back and even got one more for my oldest son. Really handy to have when you want to mix up a quick fix instead of stopping for fast food. Mine discolored a bit inside but that's more cosmetic than anything.
409,__label1__,"I knew these wouldnt be that great but I didnt think they would be THIS bad! they feel SO cheap, are WAY heavier than they should be, lost both tips the first time out, the compasses dont work and the locking mechanisms dont stay lock so you have to keep tightening them throughout your hike.

How do we know they actually do that? That is just sketch. Any company that did this, I just had to look further into. Check out their Krill Oil product reviews, other customers had similar complaints about fake reviews.<br /><br />SO LOOK AT ALL FAKE THE 5-STAR REVIEWS! Why have these customers only reviewed Viva Labs products, or sometimes nothing else. It's a little bit weird when you start to look at it. The easy answer is the reviews for charity donation bribe.<br /><br />Started to look into the company. Another reviewer pointed out that they were a Kentucky corporation but were foreign owned. It is easy enough to do a google search, so I did one but I did not find a facility. I only saw the generic office park. This is some sort of shell company or something? Even more strange. Where is their location at? Where do they make this stuff and where does it come from?<br /><br />Too many weird occurances for me to put it into my body."
412,__label1__,"The author of ""Hell"" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In ""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list."

It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos.<br /><br />The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay.. I also tried the 70-200 f2.8 and it's way more better. It's a good telephoto lens for the price.."

It soaks in fast and does a good job to brighten my skin, I didn't think I could ever find a serum like this that wasn't oily but it isn't. It does leave my skin soft. I very much like the results which I would give a 5 but only for the smell I gave it a 4."

K-cups make it really easy to measure and be on the run. Green tea is my favorite flavor and bigelow is amongst my favorite brand. I find these cups to be flavorful and not dull like so many alternatives. I also appreciate that it's not sweetened to death like some green teas.<br /><br />There are always those mornings where a little extra flavor can't hurt. Adding a dash of green tea powder {[[ASIN:B009PICJTS All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]} gives me the extra hit I'm looking for as well as a jolt of natural energy. I much prefer tea to coffee or other stimulants. Plus I don't have any crash which is always important. I don't need the extra always, but it's nice to have it and be able to add it accordingly without challenge."

I told Amazon what I got and they said that I return the item and choose new one, because this one was out of stock :((.<br /><br />I choose another Helicopter which was far more better, It's Mini Radio RC Helicopter (http://amzn.to/12NArYx) which is cool and which worked from the first time I bought it :).

The week after that I actually gained 3 of those pounds back even though I was doing the exact same routine. The third week I've managed to lose 4 more pounds from where I was in week 2. It's hard to say if I'm going to get consistent results from these at this point. I'm going to go ahead and finish off the bottle and possibly try another one.

It is a very effective product.    That said, I do like using this. It creates a lot of heat and perspiration. That has meant some loss of weight already, although I wonder if this is simply water, rather than the fat we are promised. Will return after more time and report my final findings. All in all, a recommended product, just make sure to use properly."
466,__label1__,"This isn't anything special. They're just fine. My nieces appreciate them though, so I suppose I can't really complain."
467,__label1__,"The size is ideal for a meal, perfect depth and width. The swirl of color is a little tacky looking so when I reordered, I went for the pure white. solids would be better to add color to the line."
468,__label1__,Gave it a four star only because there is really no information with it .Recipes for salad dressing mainly need some directions of what you can do with blender as a whole .
469,__label1__,"Had this product for about three weeks now and have lost eleven pounds, not too bad I guess. The DVDs are fun and high quality but I think my results would be better if I followed the nutrition plan that comes with the product. So I'm giving this 4 stars and will update to 5 if my results continue even without nutrition (I don't like changing what I eat). In any case, so far I've lost a good amount of weight and my stomach definitely looks better.<br /><br />P.S. For the one reviewer who didn't like some of the other reviews here. I bought this product on the baladea website and reviewed it since I always review my purchases here. It's not very nice to call people dishonest without any evidence. I recommend you try the product and write a comment based on that."
470,__label1__,"I am a bit thin side and 5 foot 3 inches which is a little bit shorter than the average girl. That being said, I feel like this one size fits all thing is not working, every time I keep finding myself pulling up the waist since it likes to sag down a bit. It has become very annoying since short skinny girls will not be able to do any good exercise like they want to. Forget about running, you will find yourself like one of those saggy pants guys that have no belts. The texture is okay but not great, surely not for the price. In the mean time I will be looking at other better designed leggings"
471,__label1__,"I was looking for satin or silk pillow covers to help prevent sleep wrinkles on my face and less ""behead"" for my hair. I have used a silk pillow case in the past & found it very helpful. I did NOT find these cases helpful at all, and in fact seem to have worse results."
472,__label1__,"I was just on  the Internet a few weeks ago and heard complaints about these chinese water ionizers.  These are the Aqua Ionizer by Air, Water and Life that are supposed to be made in the USA but are really made in China.  I bought my unit about 8 months ago and we used it for a while but really didn't notice any difference in our health.  We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy.  We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them."

475,__label1__,From chew toys to bitter apple we tried everything to stop our dog from chewing random stuff. But those only worked to slow him down. With the collar it was easy. Whenever he started chewing anything he was not supposed to we gave him a little shock and it worked like a charm. After a few training sessions he has now completely discarded his chewing habit.
476,__label1__,This is a great table. Well setting for outside wedding celebrations and these are sturdy and good for parties!
477,__label1__,"Yeah, I have bought it and I received it today, Just saying that I got the wrong charger because it's too large and the laptop's plug cable is too little. This messed up I was excited when I received it, but then, it gave me the wrong charger."
478,__label1__,"It includes a good beginners-level dictionary that would also serve the needs of travelers. Beginners frequently look up words (too frequently--they should take the meaning from the context when they can, and look up words only when necessary)."
479,__label1__,I think it just could no longer efficiently handle all the wireless devices nowadays. I did not hesitate one bit to get another refurb from Netgear and neither should you!
480,__label1__,"This was great at first, but I guess our dog just wouldn't put up with being forced not to chew on stuff. He just pulled it right off."
481,__label1__,I was quite pleased with my purchase. It was a gift and my husband was happy with the item. Your selection was great and I was happy with my purchase. I will purchase products from you in the future!

483,__label1__,A well written debut novel by an author I hope to see more from.  It's obvious she put much research into her characters and settings.  Her descriptions make you feel like you are there.  The story line is original and engaging.  Great read.
484,__label1__,"We bought one of these for a studio task lamp and were so pleased, we decided to get another for an office desk. The second one came with a small locking washer having fallen off but it was a snap to replace. The lamps work perfectly and were just what we needed."

487,__label1__,"The Power Fire Dept. Rescue Truck is huge, at over twelve inches long.  It is really cool looking and the kids love playing with it.  It has lots of great detail, looks really cool, and is as fun to keep on display as it is fun to play with.  It is a great Fire Truck with a really cool paint job and graphics.<br /><br />The manufacturer provided ours for free for us to test and review."
488,__label1__,The glasses arrived quickly and completely intact. The glass is heavy and substantial in addition to being very attractive. They will be used during family gatherings for many years to come. I am satisfied.
489,__label1__,"The iPad is awesome, as you'd expect. Most of the accessories are great. However the keyboard is cheap and the case is bulky. I went out and bought a smart case immediately and I've yet to even bother messing with the keyboard again. But like I said, the iPad is worth every time."

493,__label1__,If you like music games and have a PS3 this is great choice. I enjoy playing this and it is relatively family friendly rated.

495,__label1__,I was ify about buying an electronic device online but when I received this I was so excited! And even more excited after I tried it!!!! I can't find any negatives to this product. It does what it needs to and it looks great doing so!
496,__label1__,I can say is I lost 10 pounds that I had put on in 4 weeks with no changes to my eating habbits. My appetite was decreased as well. If this product can keep me at my desired weight I will be very pleased but its a slower process than what I thought.
497,__label1__,I'm a college student and I am still getting out of my &#34;teen&#34; skin. I have oily skin and most moisturizers break me out easily or cause my skin to look oily. This did neither. It goes on beautifully and the smell is great. It absorbs quickly. I wake up and notice my skin is smooth and brighter than before. I doubt I will ever stop buying this product!!
498,__label1__,"[[VIDEOID:mo1VCXYZDV0IJLW]]This case is thin, light and does not cover the iPad's bezel.  However, they just use really cheap materials and the cover does not stay closed at all.

499,__label1__,The material that this rack is made of feels nice and the stemware feel really easy to put in too. Now I don't have to keep worrying the glass will get fogged or up something when putting them on the surface.
500,__label1__,"I do not buy my lattes anymore, I make them myself. I use whole milk in my coffee and this works great with it. It works great with soy milk too. I've noticed the milk needs to have some fat in it in order for it to get fluffy. It also works if the whole milk or milk is cold, I also enjoy iced lattes.Super easy to use and clean; and makes the perfect latte everytime."

I love the scent of this product and how refreshing it felt on my skin. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and can tell that this product is working on tightening and firming my skin. While I still have my cellulite (and know nothing will actually cause it to disappear completely), I can tell that this product does do a little at helping to reduce it or the appearance of it. I also love that this product hasn't caused me any odd reactions and only pleased my senses and skin!"
502,__label1__,"Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective."
503,__label1__,"Not a great supplement, I felt some strong nauseating side effects after every dose and often felt dizzy and light headed. Don't know how this is sold online or who would buy it but I'll be staying away in future."

506,__label1__,"This does not work with T-Mobile 4G! I purchased this based on the item description, which says that it works with all major cell phone companies in the US, with some listed exceptions. T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install."
507,__label1__,It doesn't have a cross bar between the back wheels so I'm not constantly kicking it and the handle bar is tall enough that I don't have to slouch! I'll still use my stroller for our big walks and outings but the stroller is the best backup for travel!!!
508,__label1__,I used this book to take my daughters to trips throughout California. It helped me select the most interesting places. I didn't use the accomodation section as I didn't find it as helpful.
509,__label1__,"I really like my skin products to have vitamins for the nutrition of the dermal cells, and this one contains so many essential oils too. It really helps to remove impurities and clean the pores, and every part where I apply it, improves it appereance to look younger, and feel smooth, soft without oily residuals that other products left"
510,__label1__,This is one of the most bogus products to ever come out. I am not sure if the rand make a difference but this particular item does not work at all. Don't believe the Hype!

514,__label1__,I have  thick hair and needed a dryer that wouldn't take forever to dry my hair. but it does the job and doesn't make my hair too frizzy . it's just a little bit noisy
515,__label1__,"This is not the best one. It is advertised as 17&#34; cooling pad, but my 17&#34; laptop hangs off the edges a good inch on each side. The plastic feels cheap, this isn't something you would put on your lap. Also the fan is really weak, but  it is quiet."
516,__label1__,"I love this value pack because I am horrible about remembering to order more ink. This brand has a 2 year shelf life, which gives me plenty of time to use it up. The quality print is awesome as well."
517,__label1__,The comb arrived splintered in 2 places and its so cheap not worth returning. Stick with a kent comb.

520,__label1__,"there is nothing more to say except that it is a cheap working  plug adapter, I would only hope that this one would last longer than my previous one"
521,__label1__,The sticker is too small for people to even notice.  I shoulda just put it on my bedroom door. It would have made a better impact.
522,__label1__,Great comforter and it feels good on my skin. Not getting too hot or too cold with this. Feels great to finally have good bedding.
523,__label1__,it's good at what it does and the price is super cheap. I just wish it didn't take that long to get to me.
524,__label1__,"They seem to be more durable than regular toys and are always pretty educational. I know what you're thinking...it's a ball for a baby...how educational can it be? Well, to be honest I think it can be very educational."

526,__label1__,I keep a small purse with me al the time because I like to carry a few bills and change when I go out for lunch or coffee. This is just perfect for me. It does its job. The zippers are pretty strong and the fabric is okay. I got mine in Navy. It fits my pocket and does not make it bulge.

I anticipated the comming of the dress I would wear for my birthday party next month. It came not only promtly, but EARLY!! I opened the package and tried it on and looked like a sausage link in its plastic casing. Granted I AM plus size (2-3x)but i assumed, and that is my fault, that one size fits all meant... ALL... big mistake. The fabric is a bit itchy/scratchy as some other reviewers stated but not to the point that you would be scratching the whole time wearing it. You can choose to wear the halter strap or not. The print is beautiful, the length is nice about knee/calf depending on hieght. The tube is stretchy, just for regular sizes, not plus. Great buy for reg sizes, plus size go to target its not much different in price, and this should not be listed when you search for plus size dresses."
20501,__label2__,A wonderful Clark!!  Just what I expected.  Very comfortable and a nice looking shoe.  I could not be happier. I Love Clark Shoes!!!!!!

20503,__label2__,After a while it looses friction and shape. Does what it is supposed to do and I have used it in extreme climates: Arizona summers and Canadian winters. Worked as advertised. It can slip and fall when making turns at elevated speeds
20504,__label2__,Im writing this review about amazon.com on this game I purchased because either Amazon.com or the Seller has issues. What is pictured is the BLACK labeled for sale and under sellers or Amazon.com have no idea about these things maybe. They also have the greatest hit. So this pretty much is lieing to US the consumer about the product we are trying or about to purchase. Everyone just watch out because if you want the BLACK label game and you may receive the GREATEST HITS version of the game.
20505,__label2__,Well I don't have much to go on because the front half of my case was broken when I received the package.

20507,__label2__,"I ended up wasting my money, its not that the controller itself is bad I love the feel of it. The problem is that none of the controls worked even with a joystick emulator. Well designed, badly made."
20508,__label2__,"A really lovely and shapely suit, very well made too. I'm glad I read the reviews though. It tends to run much smaller. I wear size L and having read the reviews I thought it'd be safer to order XXL - I thought it'd be better if it's a little loose than too snug. BUT it fits just perfect. So beware of that. Other than that, highly recommend."
20509,__label2__,"This product is exactly as it is described. The only thing I thought would be different is the size of the gem. It looks bigger in the picture, but it's still better than a plain ball. I have not had any problems with it, so I would definitely purchase it again."
20510,__label2__,"I never expect the quality of this product. it is awesome. I am using at AT&T and it only shows 4g or 3g not 4g LTE, but still when I check the speed of data, it is between 5-10 mega bytes per second. it is fast! also, it manage memory well, too. it is really good product.I really recommend this product."
20511,__label2__,"This little TV packs a punch. It is light enough to carry without duress, but when you plug it in, you have a perfect picture, perfect for video games, TV shows, computer hook-up, whatever we like. The WIFI is wonderful and allows us to use the TV without cable or internet hook up. It is a simple TV to use, but a wonderful addition to our entertainment life!"
20512,__label2__,"Most slip-ons are a bit snug just so they stay on so that was expected.  But they are just as comfortable as my CROCs, that I am pretty sure that I am going to buy another pair after wearing them 24/7 for two days."
20513,__label2__,Huge hit! Gift from our kids to Daddy. He loved it and wears them often. Subtle humor to his wardrobe.
20514,__label2__,The socks do run a little large (I am usually a womans 8 or 9) but they are great! They are really cute and the color combinations are great. Would totally buy again.
20515,__label2__,"I'm upset with this company, I previously cracked my screen on my Galaxy S4 phone, so I decided to purchase a replacement screen to fix my phone.

20519,__label2__,Sizes are smaller than stated much to tight especially the toes. Will not be ordering these socks again as I will stay with my reg ones .
20520,__label2__,"Very nice, no surprises.  Only folks who are on board will know what it means, which is a good thing."
20521,__label2__,"I bought this  as a way to get myself to exercise. I am thin and healthy but I HATE working out. This turned out to be much more difficult than I expected. I had hoped that there would be several components that would be easy for anyone and that I could work my way up to the more challenging parts. Well even the so-called warm up just about killed me. I fell like I am too old (61) for this and will never be able to keep up with the intense pace of Zumba. I guess I should have bought a Richard Simmons Sweatin to the Oldies DVD instead. LOL Buy this if you are already pretty fit to add to your arsenal of workouts. If you are old and out of shape, this is too hard for you."
20522,__label2__,"I was given a Culinary Arts Institute Cookbook when I married in 1966. Mom knew I was ignorant about kitchens and food.

My hardback copy is now held together with packing tape. :-) I learned all I know about cooking and presentation from this book.<br /><br />I'm looking for a modern, hardback copy do I'll have ""my"" cookbook when by old one finally falls apart from use."

It hits right at the knee, which is perfect because I don't like my skirts too short. I'm 5'5. I really like the elastic waist band. I ordered a Large and it fits perfectly. I did measure myself and then pick the correct size based on the size chart that is provided by the company (not the default amazon chart). I just ordered 2 others and can't wait to get them!"

20525,__label2__,"Nice sports bra, but fit is off. I wear a 34/36 C in bras. I had originally ordered 2 of these in Medium from another site. The band size was good, but the bra part squished my girls. I ordered the Large from Amazon and the chest is good, but the band is really loose. I'm going to keep them anyway. I'll run them through the dryer the first time. I accidentally did that with another sports bra and it shrunk a lot.."

I learned so much about that time in this book, because it is written from a unique perspective, very realistic compared to how we romanticize the 60's persona. I enjoyed living in France through Janet Magill and was intrigued by her growth, the dangerous adventures and the discoveries of a young woman coming of age. I will miss Janet and Aaron!"

I read the reviews and for the most part the FOFA seemed the way to go, so When I received the two finders I put one in my wallet and one on my key chain paired them by assigning a number. For the first few weeks everything was great until my wallet started beeping, I took the battery out reset it and everything was fine then it did it again and again on and off for about a week. One day I decided to see to check them to make sure they were still working properly, the good news is they could still find each other. the bad news was the range for one was only ten feet (also this finder was able to be covered and still found), the other finder could only transmit when it was six inches away and there could be nothing,  absolutely nothing in the way otherwise you could be pushing the designated button all day and never find your keys when they were a foot away tucked under a pillow. I have never taken the time to write an amazon review because I am usually satisfied with what I get but this FOFA has let me down. Maybe I was just one of the unlucky ones who received a defective product, but i'm not willing to fork over anymore money to find out."
20539,__label2__,"Bought this wig for a community theater play to wear for about 10 minutes onstage each day. Fantastic product! Looks just like the picture. Good price. The wig comes in a solid, hard box with netting; great for re-storage. It's thick enough and definitely does not have bald spots. The top curls are well secured with some kind of bobby pins. The side curls held up very well after two months of handling (taking it out, putting on, repackaging). It has elastic straps inside for size adjustment.<br /><br />Things of Note: I tried it first with just my hair pinned up. It was a little loose and the next strap adjustment notch was too tight on me. Next I tried it with a cheap wig cap which really made the wig slide around. The cap got a run after the first usage and got tossed anyway. What I found worked great for me was a pair of control top panty hose with the legs cut off and tied to make a wig cap. The ribbing texture on the hose gave the wig something to grip to and it stayed on securely and comfortably, even through some light activity (tilting head back and a slight skirmish with other characters onstage). Recommend also using a few bobby pins for extra security. The last thing any actress wants is to lose her hair onstage.<br />The bangs are a little long and do have a tendency to get in one's eyes. The plus side is they are very thick and don't look cheap. I suppose you could trim them, however I couldn't bear to cut such a beautiful wig."
20540,__label2__,"I bought two of these to cover the center threads of my Pandora bracelet. They are stamped .925 sterling silver as described and very pretty in person. They look just like Pandora's &#34;Crazy&#34; clips, but at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Sadly, I ended up returning them because the holes are a bit too small. One clip kept popping off the bracelet, and after a few times refused to stay closed any longer. The other clip was just too tight around the thread and I was afraid that it would twist and break the bracelet, since the bead didn't rotate as the bracelet rolled along my arm.<br /><br />Even though they don't really fit as intended, they still would work as regular beads or an end lock on a Pandora (placed just before the end thread so that the other beads don't fall off) or any other brand 3mm bracelet."

The straps are kinda complicated when putting on the seat & it makes it hard to put in a dvd.

20551,__label2__,"I initially bought the 47LM7600 but I got the impression it is an open box item so I decided to send it back and get a refund while at the same breath go bigger and get the 55LM6700!!! When I got the TV I wasn't disappointed and the size was just about right, in a small to median size room I warmly recommend to get the 55"".<br />Picture - The picture quality is amazing but keep in mind you might need some tweaking to set it up by YOUR standards, it took me about 3 days of tweaks here and there until I got the image quality I like. the TRU MOTION feature is definitely unnecessary as you will get the infamous ""soap opera effect"" because of the high frame rate, I only use it for sport and live shows, the image quality is as GREAT without it. I'm not experiencing the flashlight issue as some mentioned here.<br />3D - 3D is with no doubt high end quality perfect picture as well, I also own a VIZIO 3D TV and have some issues with its 3D, like uneven 3D image and the right bottom corner always blurry, with the VIZIO you can see a clear 3D only if you sit in front of the TV at the same TV height. These issues don't apply to the LG, I can sit in all angles of the TV and still see a normal and even 3D image, and...you get 6 pairs of 3D glasses. the 2D->3D feature is 'cute' but not perfect and I probably won't use it but who cares that wasn't the reason I got the TV.<br />DLNA - The DLNA is awesome and one of the main reasons behind this purchase, it connects to media servers on your computer and plays anything I tried so far, whenever it recognizes a media server it adds it to the input list all you need to do is then go to you computer and allow this connection, you can download the LG share software.<br />Smart/Apps - Well this one is a big disappointment and I hope LG will add some more serious, useful and entertaining apps. I only use netflix but it would have been nice if they had a better selection. I didn't check other smart TVs besides VIZIO so maybe boring apps selection is common with smart TVs, I can say the VIZIO selection is not better.<br />Browser - the browser is very nice although when trying to watch online videos it will crash saying its out of memory.<br />Remote - I read some reviews here complaining about the remote, well...it's not as bad as ppl  indicated here and I didn't experience any issues operation it but keep in mind you can't fully operate the TV without the magic remote, the funny thing is I saw video reviews where the host tried to lay the remote on its back and complaining it always fall...WHATS THE PROBLEM LAYING IT ON ITS SIDE?!...other remotes you can't lay on its side, this one you can.<br /><br />Pros - Price, image quality, 3D, DLNA....for me it's basically almost everything but depends on preferences there are some cons as follow...<br />Cons - 2D->3D is not perfect in-fact useless, low end Apps, glossy screen(like a mirror in day time).<br />*** I really didn't like the packaging of this TV as well it really looks like an open box...I will write a packaging review with images.<br />  Also the shipping was by a private company because it was over 48"", It was a free 2 day scheduled delivery for Friday, they called me the day before and said they will ship it the next Thursday, I didn't agree and told them it suppose to be shipped tomorrow...they started to negotiate the delivery day until I got tired of it and told them I'll contact Amazon, they immediately changed and said they will deliver it at the scheduled time.<br /><br />If anyone would like me to share my picture setting let me know."

The recording quality has been very good, and I find the machine easy to use.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is the following: A few of the controls can be tricky to figure out, such as ejecting a video, and setting the channel. Also, although there are 5 different recording speeds for DVD, there is not a 3 hour speed...there is a 2 hour, then the next is 4 hour. Many movies may be just over 2 hours, and going to 4 hour you lose more picture quality than you<br />would with a 3 hour speed. However, overall, my experience so far has been very good, and the price was right.<br /><br />I would recommend this machine."

These are people who are in the right job and contribute positively to the organizations culture.<br /><br />Then multiply that number by the condition of your organizations relationship.  Relationships between employees, between management and labor, between the organization and its customers and suppliers.<br /><br />The perfect number you can have is 1000, but that is probably impossible.  A number of 729 means you are running at full power.  500 to 700 means you are doing pretty well.  Below 500 you need to do some work.<br /><br />That is the premise of the Power Score.  The book is written in a question and answer format, the authors asking the questions they believe the reader would ask and then answering them.  It actually makes for an easy read and makes it easy to explain some of their more complex thoughts.  Overall there is nothing earth shattering in this book, it all comes down to basic common business sense, the authors just organize it in very thoughtful way, and they support all of their claims with references a large pool of research they are pulling from.  They offer ideas and strategies to improve your score in all three of the categories.<br /><br />So I don’t think this book offers any earth shattering ideas, it is full of a lot of good ones.  Worth a read if you are in a position to alter your organization for the better."

20592,__label2__,"This is only my second LCD t.v. and my first edge-lit LED.  It is also the first time I bought a Sony television.  My wife wanted to try since she really buys into the idea that Sony is simply more dependable.  And we were both happily surprised to find this 40-inch LED at roughly the same price as the corresponding Samsung model.  I was a little worried given that it is a new model and not very much reviewed yet.  But, hey, Sony right?<br /><br />For the most part, it's a great set.  The apps work surprisingly well given how bad wifi streaming is on a lot of Smart televisions.  The picture is fantastic from the right distance.  Sound is strong.  4 HDMI ports is amazing along with 2 USB ports so you can power a chromecast without plugging it into the wall.  Set up was easy.  The set is incredibly light.  All the ports worked and the menus react quickly.<br /><br />There are two noteworthy problems.<br /><br />The first seems to be a design flaw.  The power supply plugs into the back of the television in a very insecure manner.  It just barely clicks into place and the slightest touch can jar it loose.  Once you're set up this may not be a problem, but if you ever have to mess with anything in the back of the set, it will turn off on you and the plug may just outright fall out of its place.  Kind of amazing give how basic &#34;power supply&#34; is to product design. The chord between the t.v. and the power brick is also way too short and if you place the t.v. on a somewhat tall t.v. stand, the brick will need to be taped to something or supported somehow.  This is only compounded by the problem with the plug as the weight of the brick will easily pull the plug out of the back of the t.v. if it isn't secured. So, electrical tape may be your t.v. companion!<br /><br />The second problem is more annoying and seems to be a manufacturing flaw in the set I was shipped, which is disappointing given that we went with Sony exactly to avoid just that.  There are visible blotches of light that appear near the bottom of the screen on any white or light-colored surface that is moving (like when watching a hockey game or soccer match).  It is very distracting in those situations but not noticeable in most others (like watching a movie).  You can also see them pretty clearly on any solid background that is somewhat light.  It's true that uneven light or backlight &#34;bleeding&#34; is fairly common in LED's, but amazingly, in this case, if you get close to the screen and look down toward the bottom edge, you can see a second screen behind the front panel, some sort of thin plastic screen that is meant to diffuse and distribute the light evenly.  You can see that is is curved away from the panel in one spot at the bottom, just to the right of the Sony logo.  It is supposed to be straight and flush against the edge and stretched tight.  It is also supposed to be invisible to the eye I would guess.  But instead it is sort of &#34;warped&#34; or wrinkled in this one place, or maybe just wasn't set in place properly so you can see it behind the main panel.  I'm pretty sure this wrinkle is causing the waves of uneven light just above it, along with a little dark splotch near that spot.<br /><br />It's only been two days and I don't think I'm going to exchange it.  It is only distracting in certain situations and some uneven lighting is just a common issue with edge-lit LEDs.  I figure that the next one will likely have some other slight issue or other and I don't care to be one of those Amazon customers that cycles through product after product over fairly minor glitches until I get one that is perfect, especially when it comes to something as finicky as the edge-lit LED t.v.s that seem to be a bit of a lottery.  But it is disappointing to see such an obvious and easily detectable manufacturing flaw as a warped diffusion (or whatever it is) screen show up in a product that is a pretty big ticket item for us ($500 is nothing to snuffle at).<br /><br/>I have no reason to think that this is a common issue and, in fact, searching around I've found no mention of anything like it with this or other models.<br /><br />Meanwhile our other t.v. is a five-year-old &#34;budget&#34; Samsung that has had a perfect picture from the moment we got it."

The mount is very stable, holds Samsung S4 Active and its case very firmly.  Tripod is rock solid, doesn't droop or slip. Don't waste your time or money on a cheap knock off, go ahead and spend a few extra dollars on this name brand model.  The mount alone is worth the cost of the deal and can be used on a full sized tripod if you ever need one."
20604,__label2__,"It's a solid product, which I've used for two years.  Plays AVIs from usb drive and dvd media without a hitch.  Only thing lacking is HDMI port."
20605,__label2__,"I have a number of other books about using Blender and this one seems to nearly complete my requirements.  Starting from knowing zero about animation or digital modeling, this book and the others have brought me nearly to the point of believing I could animate a very short film using Blender."
20606,__label2__,"I love the screen protector, but I just wish I had one more chance to install the product.  I watched the youtube video which was really helpful and also followed their recommendation to install it the bathroom environment after a shot shower, but alas, not perfect.  I still see two tiny small bumps on the screen which I don't believe will be going away.  I tried numerous times to cleaning it, but no go and dried with the two bumps on there.  Love the product and the installation, it's just not as easy for a novice as myself."
20607,__label2__,"Worked great  Product was sent new, just had to switch my driver board into new product then plug and play"
20608,__label2__,Love this player!  No problems with set-up or streaming.  The one downside is the small size of the screen shots when you are trying to pick a movie.  They are very hard to see. Still a good product for the money.

20610,__label2__,"When my Lexus stereo began spitting out Error 3's and 4's, I knew it was a matter of time until I had to replace the stereo. This handy bracket allows you to install modern double DIN head units while keeping a seamless look with the silver factory console of that era. The kit came with the dash piece, a single din sleeve and brackets, the fit was perfect and the head unit also fit perfectly into the bracket area."
20611,__label2__,I love this haven't taken it off since I got it!!! My husband is a towboater it's a great way to show I'm anchored with him!
20612,__label2__,Nice case for Samsung Intensity 2.  I originally bought the blue plastic case at the Verizon store when I bought the phone for my daugther.  It cracked within 2 months.  This case is a much better case at 1/2 the price.  I would recommend it.
20613,__label2__,"These shoes were beautiful coming out of the box, but not so great on my foot. The fit was as if it was a wide with shoe, although it was medium. So I had to return these"
20614,__label2__,"I've been looking at earring cuffs for a while now and desperately wanted one because they all look so gorgeous. I didn't want a heavy, obnoxious looking one though, so I decided to go for something smaller but still noticeable. This was my Christmas present to myself, along with a few others, and it arrived a day right before Christmas so I was really happy about that. When I opened it up, I saw that it was small, a bit smaller than I had expected, but I liked it anyway. It took some adjusting but I had finally gotten the hang of it. It's so easy to adjust to your ear and I found it really comfortable. You hardly notice that it's on, once you get it on the right spot, and I wore this for my annual family Christmas dinner. I got a lot of compliments on it!"
20615,__label2__,I love the looks of the phone case but the buttons were difficult to press.  I tossed it out after one week of struggling with it.

20617,__label2__,"I read this book as an impressionable 12 year old, around 1970/71.<br /><br />At the time, I was attending schoool in what was considered a pretty tough are of Birmingham (England's second city).<br /><br />It opened my eyes to the lives of my American contemporaries.<br /><br />Every time there has been a school related atrocity, since, I have thought about this book and the future it anticipated.<br /><br />I have met a few &#34;Angels&#34; in my life, but I have met many more &#34;Ricos&#34;. Which is quite scary.<br /><br />A must-read for anyone interested in how such horrors can creep up on us and a book which should be on the national curriculum reading list of all &#34;secondary&#34; (US &#34;higher&#34;) educational institutions."
20618,__label2__,The idea of the boxy is great. For the most part it runs well. I can stream videos from my computer or internet to the boxee. Sometimes the system hangs when you are using it or it disconnects itself from the LAN. The main reason I bought this was to watch movies from a hard drive wired directly to the box and this works well but has a limit of 3 Tb. It took hours to find the right firmware to update the boxee and get it connected to the LAN. The video quality is really good. The remote control is a little awkward but works well. The box is small. People talk about it not fitting on a shelf. A DVD case is taller than the box. The HDMI cable it comes with is short. It should be close to your receiver. The weakest part of the boxee is the wireless connection and programming of the software.

20621,__label2__,"Tony Scott uses the analogy of the diamond to show how God shapes each life through the trials that beset all of us. His message is that if we let in the holy spirit we will be able to bear and grow with the trials life sends us. We must trust God to not give us anything we can't bear through our understanding that he is always with us.<br /><br />This book has an excellent message, but each chapter has basically the same ideas. In one way, this is valuable because it makes those ideas hit home as you read the book. In another way, the repetition can mean that the reader begins skipping through the book looking for new ideas.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you're searching for your meaning in life and wondering why God sent trials to you. It will give you good ideas for making your life the best it can be by trusting in God and allowing the Holy Spirit into your life.<br /><br />I reviewed this book for PR by the Book."
20622,__label2__,"Very good for casual, summer slip-on.  Tan color is perfect, did not care as much for the black.  Size 6 was just a smidge small; 6 1/2 way too big.  Kept the 6 hoping it will stretch just enough, as it is a very soft shoe.  Have always bought Aerosoles in 6 before, so probably just the particular style of this shoe."

20624,__label2__,"Did not know what to expext from these speakers as they were very inexpensive, but to my surprise the sound is GREAT, great bass sound with wonderful medium and high tones. If you are looking for car jumping sound don't think these are for you, but for great sound in your car, these are a great consideration. Love 'em.  Thanks"
20625,__label2__,This case fits the Relay nicely but it is not &#34;rubberized&#34; as advertised.  It has a coating of what appears to be flat black paint.  It will not afford any more protection than the basic case itself.
20626,__label2__,"This is my third pair of these boots and I have yet to find a better boot for both working and riding. However, you really have to take care of them or they will fall apart. My last pair lasted less than a year and now they are literally ripping at the seams and have holes and cracks all in them. I wear them every day though and don't oil them often so it's not a big deal but I do wish they held up a little better since they cost well over $100. They are extremely comfortable and feel like a tennis shoe. The reason I like them most is because they are waterproof and you can just spray them off to clean them. I love these boots but do take care of them if you want them to last."
20627,__label2__,"In 2012, this book is a little dated and is a little long winded, but is still a worthwhile read.<br /><br />While some of the stories are a little cheesy, long, and at times, seemingly irrelevant - the overall message of the book is to 'get out there and start speaking the language you want to learn' and that's a great message.<br /><br />He's tried to make his book fit all purposes - principles for people learning any language.  I feel like he has cast his net too wide with this approach.  He should have just written a book that was for English speakers trying to learn Chinese, as this what he knows best.<br /><br />Anyway, while the book is not perfect, it did encourage me to speak Chinese more and to move out of my comfort zone.  I'm now trying to speak Chinese every day and look for opportunities to do so.  Before, I read this book I was too afraid.  So, for that, I give it four stars."

20632,__label2__,"I wear a US size 12, I relied on other reviews and ordered size 47, which fit well. The conversion charts equate European size 47 to a US size 14, so in that sense these shoes were small.<br /><br />The ability to adjust the rotation of the cleats was a big plus."
20633,__label2__,"These were  a gift for running.  The only downside is that they block too much sound, which is a problem when running.  Everything else has been 5 star."
20634,__label2__,"Works great. I would have given it 5 Stars if it didn't drain your car battery if you do not unplug it when the car is off. Other than that, it works exactly as described."
20635,__label2__,"I am glad that I bought this bag. It has a lot of room, adjustable straps, comes in multiple colors and it fits my style.

20638,__label2__,"I really like the design of these, but not only they came as if they are exactly made for the same ear, but also caused irritation. It makes me wonder if it's a real silver."
20639,__label2__,I bought this charm for my mother-in-law for Easter.  She has a Chamilla bracelet and I wanted to get her something both Irish and significant of Easter.  This charm fit the bill.  It's even better in person.  I will be ordering another one for my own mom.  Great charm for the price.
20640,__label2__,"To me, weaker than the usual excellent Lucas Davenport thriller. Sandford wasn't as masterful as usual in keeping track of all the variables that he normally juggles and keeps the readers on top of things. I never got a clear picture of who the escaped prisoners really were. Still its a John Sandford book so you know it isn't bad."
20641,__label2__,"Bought one of these after a failed experiment with one of those green gripgo mounts.  Just FYI, those are garbage in my opinion.<br /><br />Back on point, the first mount we ordered ended up on the dash of our CRV.  Its suction cup works well and holds tight.  The mount mechanism also works well.  Galaxy S3 is a really good git.  The LG Optimus G Pro fits well also but it requires both hands to get seated well.<br /><br />Loved the first so much we bought a second while it was on sale.  Mounted that on the Windshield of a VW Golf.  Again, great suction and fit.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend and already have to family & friends.<br /><br />Thanks!"

20645,__label2__,Love this print and the size of this bag. Can fit an iPad perfectly without being bulky. Also love that you through it in the washer if it gets dirty
20646,__label2__,"This coin purse works quite well.  Being leather it holds up better than plastic.  It takes a few uses for the leather to begin to confirm to your hand.  I never liked coins loose in my pocket.  The coin purse takes care of that.  When you pull the purse from your pocket, all the coins are there.  Removes the digging back into your pocket for the coin you actually wanted."
20647,__label2__,This TV is all it was advertised to be and has a wonderful picture.  Set up was easy.  I can recommend it to anyone shopping for a new TV.
20648,__label2__,Fast recharge time was what I like most about this unit.  It also charged my iphone very quick. I would recommend this to my friends.
20649,__label2__,"I'm a Clarks shoe lover and own three other pairs. These shoes offered me comfort, were less strain in on the legs and back after standing and walking for 8-10 hours. No break in time and wore them straight out the box. I have been looking at these shoes for three months before I bought them. I've also tried the Merrell's and New Balance line. Found these very stiff and hard on my feet. I normally wear an 8w in all my shoes. I went up a half size in these to accommodate thick socks or if you wear two pairs of socks like I do: for extra cushioning and perspiration. The width is true to size. It will also accommodate your orthotics. I recommend these shoes if you are into walking, standing at great lengths during the day. I did Disneyland, LA, CA,  all three days in these shoes with no problems whatsoever."
20650,__label2__,"I purchased the book while researching a recumbent trike to purchase for myself.  Have done extensive hikes in the US and Europe and now being 68 years old, I was particularly interested in the authors adventures going overland, as he calls it, in the western US, one of my favorite areas of this country.  I agree that his consistent message of pushing against the world of petroleum powered vehicles a bit tiresome.  But his practical recommendations for dealing with the issues that confront him in his travels, especially regarding his trike, are quite helpful, and his adventures have a real ring of authenticity that I found particularly interesting.  You really have the feeling that you are there with him as these adventures come up from day to day, so overall, a very worthwhile read, and definitely recommended.  I only wish there were in the book some of his often mentioned pictures that he took along the three different overland trips that he took over the 6 years."
20651,__label2__,"Disappointed. Took so long to get, and it was very cheap looking. Not what I expected so I never gave it as a gift. 😞"
20652,__label2__,Love these earrings.  Good size and good quality.  Don't have to worry about losing these with the leverbacks.
20653,__label2__,"Setup was very easy.  Has a great array of premium services available (Netflix, HuluPlus etc.)  Connected with no issue to our wireless network and play via the services was great.  Menus are easy to navigate.  Playback from blu ray discs has been outstanding.  2 issues with this unit have nothing to do with the unit itself but with delivery.  The unit was packed inadequately in the shipping box with it being free to slide around.  Given the state of the shipping box, I would say it was subject to a good deal of abuse during the shipping process which leads me to wonder if damage has been done to the unit (none observed at this time but only time will tell).  Secondly, it took from 2/16 until 2/24 for the unit to arrive in the Rochester NY area from Pennsylvania via USPS.  Overly long shipping time and apparently one of the reasons why the packages looks as beat as it did (any wonder why USPS has issues?)  Would purchase this unit again but only if it not being shipped USPS."
20654,__label2__,"just open out the box...finger prints smudges are hard to wipe off unless you use cleaning product... cant say yet on how long it last but not overjoyed by the &#34;protective case&#34; will change to 3-4 stars if battery last more than 2 days, and ill know b/c I work off my phone"
20655,__label2__,"This bible cover is great for protecting your favorite bible and room enough to carry your notes you desire to save. After purchasing two of these covers, I ended up purchasing two 1599 Geneva bibles and they fit just perfectly. Now my wife and I late at night open that wonderful cover and while laying down for bed we read the bible together. This of course is a good way to keep your marriage strong and your love will continue to grow. Wow! That is what is illustrated on the front cover!"
20656,__label2__,"I listen to the podcast and really enjoy the suggestions and the humor. Johanna Benal has a great way to present information in a concise and direct way, while getting to the most useful parts of training.  I am really enjoying this book and would highly recommend it."

20658,__label2__,"This is an enlightening cookbook, especially for those of us vegans who are foodies at heart and love GOOD looking and great tasting foods. The author answers all the questions you might have about how to prepare your favorite, wish I could have now that I am a vegan, foods from Europe without animal products. 3 weeks or so after I purchased the cookbook on Amazon, purely by coincidence, I got to meet the author at a cooking demonstration/class he was giving for our local organic farm, Worden Farm, Punta Gorda, Florida. He is so down to earth, so enlightening, and so willing to educate on nutrition with plant based foods. He has one award winning recipe that he shared with us and showed us how to prepare, which we then got to eat. Pistachio encrusted fillets (of Tofu)... crazy OVER the TOP! This is one of those cookbooks that, as a vegan or someone interested in plant based foods, you want to have in your kitchen. Lots of fun, lots of yum... Thank you Mark Reinfeld!"
20659,__label2__,Low profile is cool too.  Wish they had a men's version.  My wife liked it and wore it a lot on vacation.
20660,__label2__,good fit and like the style of these pants. prefer this brand over most of the competition for fit and look in plus sizes.

20663,__label2__,"I purchased this in December and we have gotten a lot of use out of these DVD players! I recently purchased a longer AV cable because the way we configured it in the car with one player in the second row and one in the back we needed a longer cable to be able to tuck it away and not have to trip over the cord whenever the kiddos got in and out of the car. With that adjustment it works beautifully. Everything as far as the players are concerned has been working great until this last car trip one of the player's doors will not latch securely so at the slightest jar or bump it will flash ""open"" on the screen and stop playing. This is not a huge deal since we always watch with them connected anyway it just required a simple DVD swap. Like I said we use them a lot and I have four little girls under the age of 7 with access to the buttons so I'm not blaming the machine. The video quality is perfect for what we use them for, the sound is great, maybe a little too great we usually turn off the sound on the player mounted behind the driver's head and leave the other one on so my husband and I can have a conversation in the car. I am not in love with the buttons to control play and pause and skipping chapters, they are very small and it is very easy to push the wrong one and start rewinding instead of playing. As long as I set the whole movie up before we head out it is usually no big deal but as far as controlling the units themselves it's too tricky for the four year olds who are the main DVD player controllers. All in all if you are debating about purchasing this item I did some serious homework on it and am very satisfied with this purchase. When these die (eventually) I would buy a second set in a minute."

Wish I would have had this book when my daughter was younger."
20666,__label2__,"My husband bought this for me as a gift and I love it.  High quality very lightweight and I recieve lots of compliments on it.  I am very picky about my watches and I love this one.  It's not &#34;top heavy&#34; so it doesn't slide around on my wrist, which I love"

20673,__label2__,"I was so excited to order this book as I have seen Debra Rothenberg's work and it is always amazing.  I was thrilled when it arrived and was not disappointed when I opened the package!  The book was more impressive than I thought it would be, and I had high expectations to begin with. The book itself is very reasonably priced so I didn't expect anything really high quality as far as the cover, etc. However, this book looks very expensive and high quality and is a great bargain.  The pictures inside are superb and although I have not read all of the stories inside, the first few I've read give background to the photographs that make them more real and meaningful. The way Debra has written makes you feel like you were a friend standing at her side watching the shows with her. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Springsteen and it would make a GREAT gift for the upcoming holiday season.  Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!!!"
20674,__label2__,The reason that I am giving this such a low rating is because of the panel manufacturing issue. Trying to get a Samsung TV with a panel made by them was a nightmare and I ended up returning 2 TV's with Chinese panels that I read were inferior.  It was too much work and I ended up buying a Sony TV.
20675,__label2__,"Pro : Excellent reception, call quality and sound quality. Good battery life<br /><br />Con : Everything else. CDMA only, so not an international phone. Very poor picture quality . Ergos are not great, the outside display is worthless, the speaker phone is badly located, the sound gets muffled by the palm of the hand, etc. Priced ridiculously high -even for free! - when you compare it with what else is available.<br /><br />Works for me because I didn't want to pay $360/yr for data and my hearing is not great."

20689,__label2__,"OK - I read all the reviews up to this.  I surveyed all (well....many of.....) the 32-inch HDTVs out there. At least the ones in the ""budget"" category.  I went to Best Buy.  Went to Wal-Mart.  I stood back.  I stared.  I reviewed specs and stats.  I vacillated between going ""cheap"" (a.k.a. ""no name"" or ""somewhat familiar"" name) and famous ""name brand"".  I run a moderately-sized independent inn  (hotel) with 20 rooms and needed to make a wise purchase.  I have a 65"" LG 3D TV at home purchased last Christmas through Amazon.  Love it...but after the ""dust settled"" in this 32-inch category.....I looked at prices and caught a sale at WallyWorld ($268)....with Best Buy matching it....I bought 20 of these babies.  Samsung....not LG.  WHY?..you ask?<br /><br />First....there is NO such thing as a non-""flimsy"" TV base.  After taking the very first one out of the box...I saw part of the ""shaky problem"".  The metal frame and the shiny black plastic overlay do not fit perfectly together with every TV.  NO BIGGIE.  I estimated the engineering issue at about 1/32""-1/64"" of ""play...front to back.  Solution? I got a cheap roll of RUBBER electrical tape (not vinyl), cut ONE 1-inch piece and tacked it on top of the base-bottom rubber pad (rear one).  VOILA.  No...more....wobble....or shake.  Sure....this COULD have been prevented with better production of the metal base and plastic molding....but what is....is.  C'mon people!  No need to bellyache....look for solutions!  It now has NO wobble.  Yeah...make sure that you ""crank"" in the 7 screws so they bottom out....and a slight extra crank.  You're done.  Attach your coax.....attach the power cord.....turn it on.....click...click....click.....wait for the channels to memorize (if you have cable, etc.) then wait the 10-15 minutes of plug-in-play programming to finish up.  Program the date and time.  Enjoy your TV.  Samsung has a great rating for a reason.  Clean.  Bright.  Crisp.<br /><br />Oh...the LG was my second choice....but I preferred the brightness/vibrancy of this Samsung.  Plus the ""swoopy"" design of the lower part of the TV frame in front seemed more ""modern"". I DO wish that there was a volume limiter option...but, alas....this is a consumer-grade TV...not an overpriced ""hotel grade"". SUPERB VALUE at this price point.  Oh....don't sweat the 60Hz vs. 120 or the 720p vs. 1080p.  At 32 inches.....your eyes/brain will HARDLY know the difference.  Sorta like the difference between 87 and 92 octane.  You'll hardly notice.  Except for the $50-$100 dollar difference.  I noticed THAT! BTW, there is NO ""tilt"" on this base.  I have NO idea where THAT previous comment came from....<br /><br />I may write more as time goes by.  For now....I have 12 more TVs to install.  Anyone want twenty-three 27-inch, 60lb CRT (tube) prehistoric TVs?  Goodwill, here I come....<br /><br />UPDATE 11/9/12:  I am still VERY please with this TV.  I have the open-box-to-all-set-up process down to 5 minutes (plus the self-programming which takes about 15 minutes).  Indeed, there is a consistent, very SLIGHT off-level issue with the stand base.  One 1-inch slice of rubber electrical tape on the REAR bottom pad is all it takes.  There are NO issues with ill-fitting screws AT ALL.  Just eat your spinach beforehand so you can put a bit of ""umph"" in your final twists - they are self-tapping. This is really a great bang-for-the-buck at $268 (WM)."

20713,__label2__,This Memorex Progressive Scan DVD player is the worst product that I have ever owned.  I have owned at least four DVD players and one recorder.  This unit is at the bottom of the list.  It freezes during playback and the controls lock up.  The only way to get it to reset is to unplug the unit and hope that it ejects your video.  This happened repeatedly and the unit is not even a year old.  Is it live or is it Memorex??  IT'S DEAD and in the trash.

20723,__label2__,"As a teacher, I am always looking for a great YA book- something that will not only entertain my students but get and keep them reading! Haven by Kristi Cook was just what I was looking for.<br />After her father is killed, Violet McKenna is presented with the choice of living with her stepmother Patsy in New York, or going to Atlanta with her Grandmother. Afraid that the frail woman could not take on a teenager, Violet finds herself in New York, at the prestigious boarding school- Winterhaven. This move will provide her the opportunity to start fresh, avoid the looks she got at her old school and come into her own. The truth is Violet has always been different. She has told friends and family that she suffered debilitating seizures but that was not the truth. These episodes were a gift she did not want: psychic visions. When Violet is overcome with these visions she is also filled with dread, for they often tell of a violent or dangerous event that will befall someone close to her.<br />The school Winterhaven is beautiful and elite, only accepting those they find are in true need of their services. Violet is not yet aware that the services the school provides are for those with psychic abilities. Her friendships there are composed of honesty and acceptance, and she finds that Winterhaven has also provided her with something more. It is through her ever growing feelings for the mysterious Aiden, that she discovers the truth about herself and this new fantastical world.<br /><br />Haven did contain some elements of Twilight, and though the similarities are there, it rose above the expected and accepted plot line of mortal and immortal. Violet is no normal girl. She contains abilities that she did not want, but by the end of the novel has come to accept and hope to perfect. To me, Haven leans more towards Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Sarah Michelle Gellar version), and empowers young female readers to embrace their differences and be who they are.<br /><br />Paranormal books set in boarding schools always catch my attention and this one did not fail. I would have loved to have gone to a school like Winterhaven (with or without the paranormal). You could watch the friendships unfold between Violet and her roommates and how she befriends the other students at her school. Violet and her friends are just like any other teenager except for their telekinesis, visions and empath abilities. They talk about boys, worry about sports and exams and miss home. The characters are incredibly real. Furthermore, it was impressive how some of the secondary characters were revealed at just the right moment.<br /><br />The pacing, though a bit slow in the beginning, was great for immersing yourself into the story and giving you the time to get to know Violet and her friends and follow Aiden on his personal journey. Just when you think you have a handle on what is going on, Kristi Cook throws something at you that you did not expect! This was a great read and something I will definitely recommend to my friends and students. I cannot wait to read more from Kristi Cook."
20724,__label2__,"Bought this as a replacement kitchen counter TV for my mother.  Her counter space is relatively small and this fit very nicely into the corner.  The picture is good and, if desired, you could enhance the sound with a bluetooth or other speakers.  But the sound is fairly decent for her purpose, that is, keeping an eye on what she has on the TV in the living room while she's making a meal, reheating coffee, etc.  However, the aging 9 inch Sony Trinitron on my kitchen counter -- which we used to say had a better picture than the long gone big Trinitron in the family room -- has become  unreliable with respect to color (blue portrayed as green, etc.).  So, I'm thinking of buying a second SuperSonic 13.3 inch for myself.  I have a large kitchen with a lot of counter space, but I am used to having only a small corner taken up by a television, and having seen how Mom's fits in limited space, I am definitely considering purchasing a second unit."

I found the actual version that was at our doctors office from another seller after this, & it was under $5!!!! Will never use this seller again."
20729,__label2__,These are a very popular shoe for volleyball players. They are only worn for games and within 1 month the stitching is coming undone. I would think for shoes that cost over $100 that they would be better made.

The lens will not move or read any disk and attempts to free the assembly from being jammed did not work.  Basically, we wasted the money and got nothing so we are trying a return."

It can also be worn as is (very long) and layered with other pieces. The quality is great, and the beads are small enough to pass for contemporary. The only drawback is the price. While I am writing this review, the necklace is listed at $46, which I feel is a bit high for this piece. Overall, though, I have been very pleased with my necklace!"

20737,__label2__,I bought these earings as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. In the picture for the item the earings look like a medium sized diamond stud essentially. I was so embarrased by the size of the earings when I got them in the mail that I couldn't even give them to my girlfriend.<br /><br />So I looked like a complete fool because we agreed to a limit to spend on each other and I couldn't give a gift that was about 1/3rd of our limit. The earrings are literally about the proper size for toddler with pierced ears. I deserve a refund as it was a complete scam and was not as pictured or promised.<br /><br />Do not buy from this seller.
20738,__label2__,"These earrings are absolutely gorgeous. My only complaint is that they are smaller than they appear in the picture. Otherwise they are great and I<br />haven't had a problem with being allergic to them, I tend to have problems with a lot of fake (and real) jewelry, especially if it has nickel in it."

Our family has android phones so the interface was pretty intuitive for us, love the ability to go on You Tube and surf the web, as well as the integrated buttons for Netflix and Amazon Video.<br /><br />I didn't give it five stars because it doesn't have a Hulu Plus app, I tried to download it from the Play Store and it said that the application wasn't compatible with my device. Also, while you have an integrated Amazon Video button and app, you can stream from it directly like you can on the Roku - which was disappointing as apparently this device isn't compatible with Amazon Video.<br /><br />Good product for the price we're definitely keeping it, if I could watch Hulu and Amazon Video it would be a seven star product."

20757,__label2__,"The Philips PB9011 portable Blu-Ray DVD Player is a pretty good option for the back seat of a car, but it doesn't offer much more than less expensive players unless you are committed to Blu-Ray discs.  Pros:  - They generally do what they are supposed. They provide an ok movie watching experience for the back seat.  - 9"" screens are on the bigger side for portable players intended for the car.  - The carrying case fits everything perfectly and easily. No jamming stuff into place or having to figure out what should go where. It really is well done. With kids, it is important that things can easily be put away properly.  - As the name says, it plays Blu-Ray discs. In reality, the quality on this player doesn't allow Blu-Rays do much more than a DVD, but if you already have a Blu-Ray disc, you can still play it in the car with the PB9011. In the past, we had to limit ourselves to DVD's just in case we wanted to watch the movie in the car at some point. Nice!  Cons:  - You can only watch one movie at a time. The second screen is only a slave to the primary. The other (much less expensive) portable DVD players that we have can work as a pair or independently.  - The volume control is a physical dial on the side of the player, so it can't be controlled by remote and it requires a little more fidgeting than a digital volume control.  - The sound is ok but not great. It sounds much more like mono than stereo and doesn't get very loud without deteriorating.  - The screen washes out in sunlight. In the back seat of a car, it is tough to control going into and out of sunlight. These screens don't do well with that.  - The cables are quite a mess in the back of the car, but that is hard to avoid with a pair of portable screens.  - The remote control feels flimsy. We'll see how it holds up.  - The screens don't tilt on their backings like our other players do. If the angle is off for the person watching the movie, you have to play with how it is strapped to the headrest insteadof just tilting it up or down."

20764,__label2__,"A warning to all, size down at least 1 size, OK, 2 sizes.  The flattening panel in the front needs to fit you like a girdle and when it doesn't, there are pooches on both sides of it, and you, at the tummy.  Washing and drying on a hot setting doesn't do much, NYDJ recommends cold water. Washing in hot just relaxes the spandex and the shrinkage is just temporary from the cotton shrinking. I was also disappointed that they were NOT Skinny. Slim, yes, but not what I expected.  I couldn't return them because the return policy states that you can't open the package to try them on, and expect to return them. The one good thing is that NYDJ positions the back pockets closer together and this is more flattering on your rear. If the prices weren't so darn high, I would order the leggings, but not having a good experience the first time, I'll pass.  Too bad, I was excited to look great in them."

I love having the guide, and while the One Pass feature is a little cumbersome, it's so much easier to arrange recordings than the Magnavox DVR I was using.  This box has all the features I need to not miss cable TV service at all.  I bought mine on a super deal with lifetime (life of the unit) service, so it was a good buy.

20774,__label2__,"A rep from the Artless Dodges Press contacted me about a review for this book and gave it a chance and hoped for a little different reading material after finished school. It was definitely different and something I would never read again or even recommend.<br /><br />I found myself just waiting for something big to happen and actually get the book going and then I looked down and realized I was two-thirds of the way done and nothing had happened, there was no plot. The main character, David, complained and complained and I wanted to throw the book at him. His girlfriend was equality annoying and the one time I was excited is when she finally discovered her backbone towards the end.<br /><br />Personally, I think it came down to the stylistic choices by the author that I couldn’t get behind. The writing is very spacey and clunky. Most of the story was pure dialogue. I missed the descriptive language and adjectives to make me feel like I’m in the book with the characters. I imagine this could be something you could adjust to but I couldn’t get my head around it, I felt like I was reading someone’s diary instead of a book.<br /><br />In the end it’s a very particular book that wasn’t too my liking, but maybe at 21 I’m just too optimistic about life and growing up to appreciate such “realism.”"
20775,__label2__,"This book opened my eyes to so many connections in the Bible that I missed, that all pointed to Jesus. I found my heart stiring, my mind being challenged, and my soul being fed deeper and deeper into the whole Jesus story.  Frank and Leonard write in such a poetic, beautiful manner and in such a way the the average reader understands what they are communicating.  This is one of the best books I have read.  It's re-awaken and deepend my faith."
20776,__label2__,I love these earrings. They are beautiful and just the right size. They sparkle just right. One of my favorite gifts received.

20779,__label2__,"I have been an avid Amazon shopper for many years, but this is the first product I am writing a review for, because of how impressed I am with the shoe.  First off, I have had fairly extensive knee problems for many years, and have had eleven surgeries, gone through hours of physical therapy for these and for ITB syndrome, etc.  To some degree the fact that I continue to be a runner is maybe a bit hard-nosed and stubborn, but I love it too much to think about giving it up.  I've tried various shoes (about 12 different pairs of runners in the past three years alone), various knee braces/apparatus/sleeves, and varied running environments from rubber track to road to trail.  I've always been an Asics guy, but have also tried New Balance, Adidas, Brooks and Nike.  I've always tried to find a shoe with extra cushion, thinking it would absorb impact rather than distributing it to my knees.  This is my first Mizuno product, which I decided to try after my Uncle recommended the brand to me based on his love for the Wave Riders; I was a bit leary, having tried multiple shoe brands, and decided on these Wave Creations based on his, and other reviews.  This shoe does NOT offer my heel that super cushiony feel yet gives me the support I need to run pain-free, even days after my runs.  I've begun to think that, like my sleep number bed, which I inflate to a more firm setting when I have back pain, that perhaps my thinking with shoes has been wrong all along, and that the more firm shoe is actually offering me more support in a similar manner.  If you're like me, and have been continually frustrated with knee/ITB difficulties, consider this shoe; it may not be for everyone but it's done wonders for me.  I have a high arch and am an under pronator; I am 5'11"" and at the time of this writing weigh an even 200 lbs.  I recommend purchasing this shoe in a 1/2 size larger than your regular sneaks, but then I recommend the same for any running shoe as it had been advised to me by a professional several years ago and I've always stuck with that."
20780,__label2__,"It came tangled in the box. My son bought it for his girlfriend, but they broke up, my daughter untangled it she likes it."
20781,__label2__,Fast shipping! As for the product have not really figured out its purpose. All it wants to do is update? I will ad more if I figure it out and it stops updating.
20782,__label2__,I like the shirt . Size 15.5. The sleeve length is fine equivalent to 32/33 and not short as few have mentioned.<br />Arrived in time and good price.
20783,__label2__,"I bought this to use as a daily journal that I carry with me almost everywhere. It has truly held up to the test of being stored in my packed purse day-in and day-out. For the price I paid, I wasn't expecting much from this journal, but it is very high quality. The pages are thick enough so my pen ink doesn't bleed through making the back of the page unusable. As other reviewers have mentioned, the look and texture of the journal is beautiful in person. The small folder in the back of the journal is an added plus!"
20784,__label2__,"Well, I just received the shirt today. Which came rather quickly than anticipated. I really like the material and is very comfortable. The only thing is that the large does fit me bigger than it should. But still love the shirt."
20785,__label2__,"Pretty nice machine, although very basic. I had it connected and in use in about 30 seconds, so obviously easy to use. Picture quality is very good. My only complaint is that the lights indicating on/off are on top of the unit, making it hard to see if its on or off from the front."
20786,__label2__,"These were purchased as a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter.  She loved these gloves.  However, they were poorly constructed and came with holes in them.  As I needed them right away for a gift, I fixed them as best as I could.  When the vendor found out my displeasure, they refunded the full amount of my purchase.  I would certainly do business with Summit Fashions again."
20787,__label2__,"They will stretch and shrink as time goes on. Wash them, but don't dry them. I wear them all the time, they go with everything!"
20788,__label2__,"These clogs have a better fit than most. I'm able to actually walk in them, not shuffle. They are very good."
20789,__label2__,"The earrings are lovely. The stones are a wonderful garnet red. The design makes them very comfortable to wear and it coordinates well with other garnet or silver pieces, especially the silver garnet pendant I purchased in the same order."
20790,__label2__,"Here's the reason why I'm giving it five stars even though it didn't fit - it came in quickly, and I should've read more of the reviews to understand how the sizing would work, considering it's still a great product. I'm 130lbs and 5'9, so I am very slim, but even a medium was too small. For any of you that are my size but already have a booty to begin with, I'd recommend getting an xtra large. It looks like you have butt pads on when you get it too small! So just be extra careful. It gave my butt a great lift, however, if I were to try to wear the medium even though it was too small, I'd have to readjust it every second"
20791,__label2__,This bracelet is very lightweight. It does not look cheap and is very durable as I wear it several times a week. It is very nice and looks better than in photo. The sapphires are actually a deeper blue than shown. This is a nice bracelet for the price.
20792,__label2__,bought these  for the  first time after reading all the  reviews on how well they  fit right  away. The fit was great a slight  discomfort with one  strap but no big deal. Big deal was them getting wet. My feet  turned the color of the straps blue! so I had smuf  feet not  sure  what  can be don't to stop the  dye from staining your  skin but the were  comfortable
20793,__label2__,"We had to return two pairs because the sticking was coming undone, and the 3rd time was a charm, or so we thought.  After having them for only 6 months these boots fell apart.  I'm really mad and disappointed with this purchase.  I wouldn't recommend."
20794,__label2__,"I watch 3D movies on this all the time.  Good quality picture, easy to operate.  I'm very happy with my purchase."
20795,__label2__,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister. We both loved it!  Nice design and beautifully boxed. Perfect choice!
20796,__label2__,Just what I was looking for to add to my collection. It matches the pics exactly and is really nicely made
20797,__label2__,"Pros:<br /><br />Easy to put on and take off with the back strap.  Looks very nice on even a size 13 and doesn't look like I am wearing boats on my feet ;-)  Clean up well after being on the beach<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The inside sole surface that contacts your feet is a very smooth rubber.  It probably helps with the easy to clean part and is comfortable but after some time, your feet sweat.  My Adidas slip ons have a very nice foam in the bottom that would have been nice on these, but then they wouldn't be so easy to clean."
20798,__label2__,LOVE this necklace!!! Very good quality! Nice weight on it. It is just beautiful!! I'm wearing it to my son's High School graduation 😉
20799,__label2__,"Wouldn't connect and would not work with my dish network remote controls, Would not play video through a camper wall."
20800,__label2__,"For the price, you cant complain. They fit according to size, they are moderately comfortable, and they look good for work. My only complaint is they almost always need to be ironed out after the wash. They easily wrinkle. but i still give it a 4/5"
20801,__label2__,"Love the jacket. Love Columbia. The jacket is super cute. Only problem is, there was a hole in the sleeve along the stitch. Not worth returning, we'll stitch it up ourselves, but not the quality control I'm used to from Columbia."
20802,__label2__,I have a horse crazy friend and thought this would be perfect for her birthday.  It is just that!  Very pretty and delicate.  It looks just like the photo and is gorgeous.  I like the fact that it is very light but still has a substantial look and feel to it.  It comes in a nice box and is packaged well.  I ended up ordering one for myself and two more for Christmas gifts for a couple of nieces who also love horses.  Don't pass this up.
20803,__label2__,"I received my first Tivo Series 2 as a gift, after a car accident over 10 years ago, in place of several VCRs I had around the house. It is still working like a champ! I have never had a single problem with it. It is still used every day. Since then I have talked my parents into getting two and my roommate into getting two. They couldn't live without them now. I currently have 3 units. It made things so much less painful after the accident, not having to go from one VCR to another and try to keep track of the tapes and shows. What a nightmare. I love that I don't have to keep up with any schedule, program and channel changes as well. Tivo recognizes any changes made and adapts from season to season. Thank you for making a product that I use every single day. Tivo kept me connected to the rest of the world for a long time. It still does. I tried going to a cable company's DVR (If you want to call it that) and it was horrible. The product and customer service was far from that of Tivo's. I paid over $300 less than two weeks later to get away from them. Tivo customer service is better than ANY electronic company I have ever dealt with. Even my dad, a tough man to impress, is extremely happy with your product, service and customer care. The capacities of units have come a long way from the first incarnation. Cable and satellite companies will be chasing, and never reaching, Tivo forever. Have a happy day. :-)  Thank you for making a quality product that gets better with each model. I am, and will be, a customer for life. :-)"
20804,__label2__,"Wow! Sleeves are super, super short! Shirt was intended for the son wearing the suit...son who received the shirt is standing in the middle. He likes his sleeves rolled up or pushed up, at least it got one wearing. Obviously the suit has the same problem, but he insisted on keeping the suit!"
20805,__label2__,"You need to buy something like this in a brick and mortar store, the EEE size was wider than other shoes I have purchased."
20806,__label2__,"Some people on these reviews say this ring runs small. It definitely DOES NOT run small. I went a size up and I should've gone a size down at least. Oh well. I'm not going to return a $3 ring, so I'll give it to my sister. It's super cute though. Would recommend!"
20807,__label2__,love love love this necklace!!! and was received very fast after order was placed!! hoping this necklace will come available again would love to buy for other people!!!
20808,__label2__,"I love it.  It is exactly what I wanted.  Though it is meant to be a charm on a bracelet, I actually just wanted a very dainty, simple daisy to wear on a necklace.  I am pleased with the quality and detail.  It is adorable.  Daisies always make me happy, and this little one does that for me. 😀  If you are buying for a bracelet, I feel you would be very happy with it."
20809,__label2__,I love Clark's sandals as I can wear them the first day and they feel like I'm wearing slippers. The color is true navy and are a great compliment to my wardrobe.
20810,__label2__,I bought this clutch for my son's wedding - when it arrived it matched my shoes exactly - it is a really beautiful piece.
20811,__label2__,"Perfect size, looks great, and is durable. I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he wears it every day. We weren't too crazy about the chain it came with but we simply slipped off the cross and put it on a silver chain that he already had. I'd say it was definitely worth the money."
20812,__label2__,"I'm giving the product a 4 star because it was what I was expecting, but when I opened the package it had a bad odor, hopefully would go away in a few days"
20813,__label2__,I purchased these for my girlfriend and she just loved them.  It was a great gift on my part and very rewarding. I ordered close to Christmas and it shipped and made it to me before Santa came.  I would buy from this vendor again with out a doubt.
20814,__label2__,This case did not match up to my phone. I have a til and the volume button is covered up. Slots don't line up
20815,__label2__,"Gets the job done. Setup was quick and easy. The performance playing back video is great.<br /><br />It loses a star for a couple of minor points.  The remote is ok, not great. There isn't a lot of distinction on the buttons and you have to look at the remote before pressing buttons instead of finding the buttons by touch.  It is not shipped with batteries, and they are CR2032s, so it's not something you tend to keep on hand.<br /><br />Response is a tad more sluggish than on the native wmc machine. Lastly, it would be nice to have Netflix integration.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the item and would recommend it.."
20816,__label2__,so I normally wear an 8.5 and I ordered a 9. They are a little snug and did not leave me with as much room as I had hoped but more than enough room if wearing a pair of thin socks. Other than that BEST BUY EVER!!! these boots are so cute.
20817,__label2__,I would definitely recommend to get these as a gift! The bracelets are just how I wanted them and they got here in no time at all! I placed my order on July 23 and got my bracelets on August 1. The quality is amazing and I can't wait to give my boyfriend his bracelet.
20818,__label2__,"I love the style of the ring, as I have purchased several rings with this design from Carson Pirie Scott. The ring arrived on time in a cute little quasi velvet pouch. The stones in channel appear to be piled on top of each other. Meaning the channel is not smooth all the way around.  This is not visible to the naked eye, but to someone with OCD, I immediately noticed that one stone was not lined properly in the channel."
20819,__label2__,"I love these boots and wear them almost daily for working in the garden and in the yard. Turns out it's pretty hard to find women's work boots that aren't bedazzled or covered in designs, but these ones are great. They fit great, seem to be pretty waterproof, and are very comfortable."
20820,__label2__,"The bluray player i bought of this model, vbr333, has software on it from dec. 2010 on it, it will not play newer blue rays, and there is no updates for the software for the player. stay away and buy from a company that actually has customer support for the products."
20821,__label2__,"Much larger than pictured. Read the product description first before deciding if you want to buy it. I saw it as a lightning deal, thinking it was typical necklace sized but it's pretty big!"
20822,__label2__,I love this jacket fits like a dream. I am 5 feet 3 inches and weigh 135 I wear a small. I have gotten so many compliments on this jacket
20823,__label2__,I bought this necklace for my daughter for her wedding.  It was absolutely perfect!  She was so pleased with it.  It made her &#34;special day&#34; even more special.  She loves this necklace.
20824,__label2__,"Great fitting, I wear a 10.5 in Nike (with socks) so got a 10 for this with no socks and to be snug. Very comfortable and lightweight. Dries quickly."
20825,__label2__,better than pictured. bought another one later. good quality. shinier than pictured. matches my other black pearl items. highly recommended
20826,__label2__,"I thought It would be too slim. However, it fits me great, not intended just for thin people. The fabric it's sturdy, thick and durable."
20827,__label2__,I had to return this bracelet because it wouldn't go around  my wrist!  I am not a large-boned woman.  It fit my four year old granddaughter perfectly but wasn't inclined to gift her with it just yet.  I have a link bracelet I am wearing that measures 7-1/2&#34; and I can slip over my hand.
20828,__label2__,"I bought this for my grandmother and she loves it. She said the writing is a bit too small, but she knows what it says and that's all that matters"
20829,__label2__,"These insoles were prescribed by my foot specialist, to be inserted in my New Balance walking shoes. I was recuperating from an avuncular fracture of the ankle and suffering from tendinitis as a result, these insoles have made a difference in support and comfort."
20830,__label2__,"The straps is cheap but this purse only cost 12 dollars, so you get what you pay for. Cute purse, I get compliments on it all the time. I've been carrying this purse around for almost a month and have not noticed it falling apart."
20831,__label2__,BEAUTIFUL! It's perfect... I was afraid to purchase it because I had a bad experience with a veil I bought online. It wasn't as described. This was exactly what I ordered.
20832,__label2__,I would love to give this tv 5 stars but can't.  Picture quality and design are amazing.  But for this type of money a tv that is less than 2 years old should not have any issues.  I bought my 65&#34; in August 2013 and as of last week tv turned on and off sporadically.  It's been confirmed by a technician that's it's the power supply and the Internet clearly shows faulty capacitors are the cause.  Pretty unfortunate for a tv that many of us spent over $4k on.  I'm not done but unfortunately Samsung just lost another customer.
20833,__label2__,"I looked far and wide online and local stores in Jacksonville, FL to find this TV within $1100 budget. This was the only place that had it. The quality of the product is great. It was easy to order online and shipped in a timely manner without any issue at all. I am highly impressed."
20834,__label2__,"I really liked this cartilage earring when it arrived and was very excited to wear something different in my ear, but the diamonds fell out with in days of wearing very disappointing."
20835,__label2__,"Pleasantly surprised by the ease of installation. Syncing to our directtv remote was quick and easy. Sounds amazing, noticed an immediate difference between this and another sound bar. Only cons are there is no back light on the remote and unfortunately the small speakers aren't wireless."
20836,__label2__,"I tested many sound bar/subwoofer combos, this in my opinion was the best.  I enjoyed it so much that I purchased another for a separate room.  The BT works great enabling to play music & enjoy good sound for a small theater."
20837,__label2__,"Awesome quality!  I've been wearing mine continuously for a few years now and it still looks like new!  I never take it off, not even to sleep or shower, etc...  the adjustable slip knot in the cord is sturdy and stays put where you leave it.<br />After these past several years of constant wear, the Cord however is finally chafing thin where it rubs at the top of the cross nails. like shoe laces also do over time...  Some day the cord will finally chafe thru completely so at that time I'll have to find a replacement cord, but I'm confident this Cross will still be shining brightly like the day I bought it for many more years to come.  I definitely recommend this necklace to others!"
20838,__label2__,It does what it's supposed to. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the little strings on the seeming started to come off after i opened the packaging but it wasn't anything I couldn't fix myself over all its a good case and shipping was great
20839,__label2__,"It is very cheaply made, I would not recommend it to anyone that I know. I was very disappointed.at how poorly it was made."
20840,__label2__,This product was made very cheap....came with no back to the nose rings.....some of the nose rings in the picture that I wanted and was the reason I left the set....didn't even come in that set.....so the picture is not what you're getting...
20841,__label2__,"- audio is atrocious, however you can connect it (via an lightning-HDMI adapter) to an iPhone/iPad that has its audio delegated via bluetooth to an external, wireless speaker. - Resolution is good, however not excellent. - Battery life is much too short, not enough for watching even a typical 2-hour movie. - On the bright side: product is very compact, has an aesthetic design and well crafted."
20842,__label2__,"We bought this for a road trip, are outside of our return window, and the VERY first time we used it, this past weekend, it skipped and restarted.  Good luck with the remote too - you have to be a yoga expert to control the thing.  The case doesn't fit it properly either, so if you hit a bump, the velcro won't hold it back and it'll flip forward.  I hate it.  I guess I'll be trying out the warranty, but guess what?  I replaced a Sylvania with this one, and that one also broke after a few months.  We follow installation instructions to the letter.  i thought this one might be different because of its decent reviews, but it was worse.  I suspect Sylvania paid for the good reviews on this item.<br /><br />EDIT:  Customer service on the warranty was awful.  AWFUL.  You have to pay to shipping and handling to return it, and $7 for them to return it to you.  And you get to speak with someone not in this country, who will make you repeat everything 150 times.  I'm not sure I'll be returning this, but I can guarantee I will not buy another Sylvania ANYTHING, nor will I buy electronics again on this web site."
20843,__label2__,Saw similar ring in Monterey for $80.00 each. Can't tell any difference from the expensive ones. Beautiful
20844,__label2__,"I've worn Rainbows for years.  When I lived in a warmer area, I wore them pretty much every day, all day.  The shoes would last about 9-10 months.  The best part is I never had the thong part rip out and leave me barefoot, which is the common frustration with flip flops.  I only replaced them when the padding started to wear out and not protect my heals.<br /><br />The double layer makes these extra comfortable, but you need to realize that rainbows must be broken it.  They are like a pair of leather boots in that they're uncomfortable until broken in.  Once that happens, they are perfect.  I recommend getting the sandals wet and walking around in them to help speed up the break in.<br /><br />This pair, for whatever reason was about .25 inches longer than the other pairs I've had in the same size.  They're almost too big, but it hasn't been a problem.  I might end up trimming them."
20845,__label2__,"I found this in Chinatown and bought one to try out. I was pleased that I can view all types of Asian TV programs. Mainly China, H.K., Korean and Vietnam. There seems to have no Japanese TV programs. There is an American Drama and it has all the sitcoms you want. Paid $170 cash(Tax included). Some programs are in HD and mostly the rest at at 720/480 lpi. The remote is not very responsive and there is a delay. I would also like to see if they can allow Android Karaoke. I tried to down load it but there is an error message. &#34;This is not compatible application for your device&#34;.<br /><br />For $170 I think it is worth it. Esp. if you like HK Cantonese sitcom and variety show. It plays very smoothly on my standard 15MB per minute internet services. Now I have to make more time for this new toy."
20846,__label2__,"These beautifully made shoes are comfortable, sturdy and fun to wear with their taffeta laces!  When ordering I didn't realize they are fitted with taffeta ribbon laces.  The more expected leather laces are included, but the taffeta ribbon is wonderful to the men's wear look, and makes these shoes feminine and fun."
20847,__label2__,"Other than a little lag every now and then, it works generally very well! We have had it for at least a year and it is still performing well."
20848,__label2__,"Okay I found some old home movies on vhs, somehow I overlooked them when I converted everything to dvd si so needed a vcr (whoda thunk?).  I ordered this garbage (see pic above).  I paid more than 2 cents for it so I was robbed.  Luckily they don't sell them anymore to my knowledge which is good so others don't waste their money."
20849,__label2__,"I purchased from Walmart for $250($268 after tax). Took me about 10 minutes to hook everything up -- sat back on the couch for an hour listening and adjusting levels with different movies/music. The system looks clean and goes well with my 46 inch Samsung. The remote that came with the speakers worked with my TV right out of the box -- and I like it better than my stock TV remote so I'll be using the new one from now on. I also like the USB plug on the right side of the bar so I can plug my phone in to charge or listen to music. I've been listening to music/movies for the last 4 hours and here's what I've noticed so far...<br /><br />Low Levels<br /> - Since the sub is so weak, you'll have to turn the sub to the highest setting if you really want to feel it in your bones. And when you crank a speaker up to the highest volume, you almost never get a clean sound. It's not HORRIBLE, but I feel like SAMSUNG really could have satisfied people a lot more if they included a more powerful sub. For movies it's not so bad, but the bass isn't crisp and sharp with songs that have a lot of kicks or 808's with low frequencies.<br /><br />Mids/Highs<br /> - The range of the actual sound bar itself is incredible...there's a real distinction between the mid/lower and highest frequencies which are all driven out at different angles so they hit your ears to closely resemble a 5.1 system. I did notice slight clipping noises when the upper range hit higher volumes though -- hopefully this will go away after the speakers get broken in. The sound really is beautiful though and I'm happy with the look/sound of the bar.<br /><br />I'll definitely enjoy these for now but I'm not impressed with the sub. I'm waiting for Vizio to release their new system which is supposed to be the next best thing since sliced bread. I'll compare the two and pick whichever ends up sounding better...but for now the E450's will be a huge upgrade from my stock TV speakers."
20850,__label2__,"I've had this TV for 2 weeks and I'm very satisfied with the performance thus far. Believe me, paying less than 290.00 (which included free shipping and for some reason no sales tax was added) The picture has been crystal clear, sound quality is good (did purchase SONY sound bar system at the same time with the money I saved) Set-up was ridiculously easy (in my bedroom) and sha-zam! Apps have worked great so far, no problem with Netflix. Vizio was suppose to introduce the M series by the first quarter of the year, here it is almost June so lost my patience and took chance on the E series, no disappointments (but damn, when are they coming out with the M series)"
20851,__label2__,"Purchased this to replace an aging 42 inch Panasonic Plasma.  The Plasma has been great but this new Vizio is absolutely amazing.  The 3D quality is stunning and the picture quality for regular 2D is outstanding.  I did quite a bit of research and boiled my choices down to LG, Panasonic Plasma, and the Vizio.  The LG looked good but the price difference was too great in my opinion.  I was leaning towards the Panasonic based on my excellent experience with the set I've owned for 10 years or so.  I went to an electronics store to see both the Vizio and Panasonic 3D and that sold me on the Vizio.  The only complaint I have is the remote which is terrible.  Fortunately I have a Harmony and that works well with the Vizio.  Buy this set.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Now that I have owned this set for 3 plus months I would like to add to my initial review.  While the set is still very good in terms of viewing pleasure it has developed some bugs in the last month or so.  The first is I sometimes lose audio, generally when changing channels.  I change the channel and I hear a ""pop"" and then no audio.  I have to turn off the set and then back on to get the audio working.  I use a Samsung Soundbar connected to the TV via HDMI Arc which works very well.  The TV completely controls Power on, off, etc.  The issue is not a problem with the Soundbar as I experienced the same thing when the TV was connected to a BOSE Cinemate system.<br /><br />The second glitch, which is far more annoying, is the TV sometimes fails to power up.  I hit my Harmony remote to Power Up the TV, Soundbar, and Cable Box and the TV fails to come on.  I have tried pushing the manual button on the back of the set but no joy.  The only way to get the TV to power up is to pull the power cord, wait 10 seconds or so, and then plug it back in.  Then it powers up and plays without any issues.<br /><br />I did get an extended warranty with the set which I think I will be using in the near future.  This is my first Vizio, and while it has many great features, I fear it is not going to be very dependable over time.  We shall see."
20852,__label2__,"I just love these visors!!  They come in so handy while out in the sun, and/or wind.  I always keep a few on stock even though they are of good quality and last forever...  Happy with the visors, plus the service I received."
20853,__label2__,"Easy set-up.  Excellent customer service from US, English Speaking Representatives.  So far no problems. Great picture, easy connectivity to WiFI, with a multitude of apps."
20854,__label2__,"I love my new mala. I've ordered several in the past from different companies. Pleased with all vendors and products. However this mala is now my favorite. It arrived on time, fair price and excellent quality. Thank you Buddha Bliss and thank you Amazon for making buying such a great experience... start selling organic food and I'll never have to leave the house again to go shopping for ANYTHING!  B )&#62;"
20855,__label2__,"I loved this bracelet. I wish I could wear this bracelet right now, but I can't because the skull keeps falling off. I noticed that every time I would wash my hands (I'm a vet tech, so I wash my hands often) the skull would fall out. It makes me sad because the two different leathers and the beading was really nice. I ove skulls and beachy themes and this encompased all of that."
20856,__label2__,"As the title states. This is an incredible quality boot for the price. I've spent over 100$ for boots that do not have the quality and comfort as these boots do for under 60$. As far as sizing, I can say for myself that I ordered my typical size 9 wide and they fit perfect. No slipping on the back heel with a comfortable amount of room on the toes. The side-zip feature is also awesome! You can have the boots tied and tucked away and can quickly unzip the side-zip to quickly get them on and off. I will write a follow up review for the boots in a few months to see how they hold up but as of now, you can't beat the price for the quality and comfort of these boots. Why spend 100-200$ when you can spend less than 60$ for the same quality and comfort?"
20857,__label2__,"These are very much like what came with my Vizio TV, perhaps a little nicer quality.  They fit over my glasses very nicely."
20858,__label2__,With its small cap size and wide bill this hat looks more feminine than masculine. It did fit (barely) my 7 3/4 size head.
20859,__label2__,"I teach.  So, I freeze all day during the cold spells so that we can keep the utility bills down and save money due to budget cuts.  I bought these boots to wear at school on those really cold days.  (It may sound weird, but even with multiple socks in regular shoes my toes get cold.)  I was able to wear them all day and teach on my feet with no problem or discomfort.  It also did the job and kept my toes warm!  Score!  I wish that I had ordered a size up.  The room in the toe part of the boot fits fine, but they would have been a lot easier to get on and off if I had ordered up a size I believe without being uncomfortable in the foot area."
20860,__label2__,"Shoe is comfortable, fits fine. Good tread on bottom, sturdy and easy to spray off sand. When wet it still provides good traction on bottom and my foot doesn't slip inside of it. Picture of it looks pink, but it is a true coral color as description states, very pretty color. Looks nicer than most flip flops on the foot and don't mind wearing it out and about. Sturdy construction as most Crocs are and expect it will hold up throughout hard summer wearing and long into the autumn for me."
20861,__label2__,This is the worst wallet I've ever purchased. I had to buy another one from another store because it broke in several places.
20862,__label2__,"Nice boots overall.<br />Only issue was what I had already read about in the views and I was willing to deal with &#34;extra room in the foot area&#34;.<br />I have large calves but a size 8 foot so where this fits my calf great, my foot isnt wide and it slides around. But im willing to suck it up for the cuteness of the noot."
20863,__label2__,"This is really sexy, fits nice and I am 5'3&#34;. I dont expect it to last through a lot of wears but so far, for the price, you simply cannot beat it."
20864,__label2__,So when it came to my house I tried it on asap. I couldn't get the thing on my ear to save my life so I gave up because I thought my ear was too big and just put it away. A month later I decided I am not going to just let this sit in my room forever and I decided to jam it on my ear. It hurt after awhile but after I kept moving it around in different positions I foung one comforable enough for it to stay on my ear. So I think you really just have to play with it a little bit in order to find the right spot for you.
20865,__label2__,Got this for my sister who just started teaching. She loved it. It's dainty but a good quality. Lightweight and shiny.
20866,__label2__,"Style and leather were very good as expected.  Was surprised to find an eyelet not in place just hanging from the lace on one of the boots.  Also, the boots run slightly larger so I am in the process of an exchange."
20867,__label2__,"So thin just not what I thought, sad they looked so cute... won't wear. to cheap, not worth sending back"
20868,__label2__,"If you are going for that super big oversized look, don't get this. It is very small and doesn't hold much. It does look nice though just not big enough for me or my mother. I returned two the same day I got them. Quick and easy refund process."
20869,__label2__,"this is a very tiny necklace;  you cannot even make out the monogram, size of a thumbtack head; back it went"
20870,__label2__,Nice earings. This ítem is about collection very quality. I recomend you get that. Try to see that in the web.
20871,__label2__,"Bought these boots for DH as a B-Day Present. Nice, but slightly large. He kept them, but wears thick socks."
20872,__label2__,Fits just below my breast and I am 5'3 if you are taller than me don't bother getting it definitely will not fit you.
20873,__label2__,"I bought this shirt for my son because he loved the movie, I am always a bit concerned when it comes to clothing online because sizes vary so much. however this one was just about right on, servie was good and we recieved the item well with in the estimated date."
20874,__label2__,"I had already bought a pair from a department store, but they were out when I went to buy another pair. I searched Amazon and using the product number on the inside tag, got another pair just like them. They are the most comfortable jeans I have tried in ages. I am an older gentleman and need room and comfort. They fit good and look good. Definitely worth buying."
20875,__label2__,This is my first experience with Y suspenders and I don't think it's a good one. The back of the Y is too short and it makes moving slightly awkward. Also after wearing twice the back now looks stretched out and weird.
20876,__label2__,"Very satisfied, wanted something to protect my ankle due to a prior broken leg (have a pin & screw near the ankle)"
20877,__label2__,Super cute and just as I expected from the description. I love all the pockets to store all the random crap in my purse! The material creates a easy to clean surface!
20878,__label2__,"Great pair of shoes. I wear this to office as office casual (or office very casual, since I wear shorts and go sockless all summer). I had the exact same pair for 5 years that I wore nearly every day before I was forced to replace them (though I'm sure I can still find another use for them for a while before the soles fall off). I wear the amaretto ones, and they're pretty sharp. Very comfortable, well made, high quality. Absolutely recommend."
20879,__label2__,"I loved the feel and look of these - they fit everywhere but they were too long.  Almost 4&#34; too long and I am not short.  They were medium length so keep that in mind.<br />I really wish they were shorter because as I said the comfort of the fit, color, material etc - perfect!"
20880,__label2__,"I knew these socks would be cheaply made by looking at the price. However, I took a chance because of all the colors the socks come in and aside from having to be careful to not rip them while putting them on, they look great!"
20881,__label2__,I would recommend this product to anyone who uses this type of glove.  I bought it for our church usher board.  Everyone like the fit.
20882,__label2__,Nice light color and fabric for this coming summer.  Hopefully it will hold up okay with multiple washings. Really cute.
20883,__label2__,"So far so good , price is good even after included shipping to Canada . Will see how last long . I like the design that look simple but strong . Next time will try with aluminum toe .The most important is making in USA"
20884,__label2__,"It's a good shoe for outdoors, lightweight, moderate arch support. What's annoying for me is the heel adjustment, it constantly slips after tightening. You'll find yourself constantly pulling (about 5-10 minutes of walking and they're loose) on the tab. Either the tab is too wide to hold fabric, or the fabric is too thin. There's just not enough friction and you'll be reaching down and tightening quite often.<br />I don't wear them as often as I'd like to because of this."
20885,__label2__,Hoodie came in on time.  Is as described.  Soft and comfortable.  Had to order another one as my girlfriend claimed this one.
20886,__label2__,These are the perfect accessory for an added look of chic to any outfit. I purchased several colors at a great price and get compliments every time.
20887,__label2__,My daughter loves them!!! We bought them in a bigger size so she can't wear them now maybe in 4 more months
20888,__label2__,"I already have these in the black patent and they are like bedroom slippers, so soft and comfy.  They seem to run a bit small, about a half size. I have a narrow foot but got these in medium. They don't slip off but they do gap on the sides when walking but they are so comfortable that is not a deal breaker.  I have very picky feet and it is hard for me to find comfortable shoes and these are winners!."
20889,__label2__,It came wrapped up in the cutest little bag and wrapped in hairnets. Fits great on my head which can be adjusted by straps in the back. The clip on pony tails are really easy to use and the whole wig looks great. It's amazingly soft and came with instructions to keep it that way. Overall a five star wig.
20890,__label2__,"The minute I stepped into these, I knew I would love them!  They feel different than any shoe I have ever worn.  Love how they look with white straight leg jeans.  They look great with bermuda shorts also.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone!  So many varieties of patterns also so any age could wear these.  MUST TRY!!!"
20891,__label2__,Couldn't get by lately with paper Kleenex.  These cotton bandanas are just the ticket.  And they are printed on both sides!!  Just the right price too.
20892,__label2__,comfortable. the inner straps are really long and slip off when the front is unclipped but otherwise fits fine I bought the black and the tan.
20893,__label2__,These pants fit great.  I have trouble with my weight being around my waist so an 8 is usually too big every where but barely buttons.  These pants have good stretch so fit through the thighs and sit nicely at my waist.  I still have to pull them up occasionally but don't sag down to where my rear end shows!  Very comfortable and look more like slacks than jeans.
20894,__label2__,I ordered this for my daughter for a play she was in. The quality is nice and it stood up well to lots of abuse on stage! The fit was good and true to size.
20895,__label2__,"At 6 feet and 150lbs, medium size fits well out of the bag but they do shrink after the first wash. Now they are great for slim fit shirts. I'll see after the second wash"
20896,__label2__,"I really love this dress! It is beautiful and fun and can easily be worn in a more formal setting (to a formal wedding, for example).  The fabric is soft and it has versatile detail. I ordered it a little larger than I should have, order your size on this one! I'm very pleased!"
20897,__label2__,Also would like to have in red and navy blue in my size (large).  A must have.  I love this dress!!!
20898,__label2__,My son is 3 years old and it's real easy for him to put on and take off his shoes independently. He wore it to Disney and did great not complains of pain :)
20899,__label2__,"My son loves these. They are awesome!  Better than the ones he lost, which he has determined, may have been knock offs."
20900,__label2__,"The Kenneth Cole loafer are nice, but unfortunately my son has wide feet and had to take these back. I would still recommend Kenneth Cole loafer."
20901,__label2__,The service was awesome but I did return it. I heard it ran small so I ordered a XL ( I'm a 8-10). It fit ok on top but when I pulled it down in front to get that Betty Grable pin up look? My tush was up too high & there was tons of extra suit just hanging there!
20902,__label2__,So cute and sophisticated style for &#34;slides&#34;<br />Super comdortable and I love the colors too!<br />I wear these everyday and I would def. Buy these again!
20903,__label2__,This is a very attractive purse. Colors are beautiful and the leather so soft. It was on the small side for me. Had to return.
20904,__label2__,Husband needs black pants for work. This is third pair of these relaxed fit pants. First finally wearing out after years of use. No need for ironing. Wash and put outside for drying.  Ready to wear.
20905,__label2__,"See through when im standing, not just bent over. Im a size 10, may not be as see through on a smaller size."
20906,__label2__,Very cute and two for seven dollars plus change is a good price. Looks much better and sturdier than the plastic bifolds.
20907,__label2__,Bought for my son and he is very pleased.  It is soft and comfortable for his back pocket.  Looks great!
20908,__label2__,"Have had these clogs before and love them.  Too bad they aren't made anymore, but I'm glad I found these."
20909,__label2__,They look and feel very cool. Many compliments so far. Fast shipping too. I highly recommend them. They are big though... which I love.
20910,__label2__,"VERY light fabric, perfect if you need to wear it under anything. I have to wear it under my scrubs so I love it. It is a bit snug and small just be ware."
20911,__label2__,I own two pairs of 7 1/2 Clark Privo that are a perfect fit. The Haley is a little tight at the instep and not comfortable for prolonged wear.
20912,__label2__,"These slippers are not strong, wore them a couple times and front is already opening and heel nearly wore down. Bought these a few years ago and the material was stronger on the top and bottom. They are now also overpriced."
20913,__label2__,"My main wallet is big and clunky. And, honestly I don't regularly need everything in it.<br /><br />This cute little wallet holds my bus pass, my ID, some cash and my debit card perfectly. When it is snapped shut everything is held securely in place.<br /><br />It even has a small zipper pocket.<br /><br />And, it is gold which those into Feng shui recommend as the most auspicious wallet color. ;)<br /><br />Finally, I was pleasantly surprised at the strength of the attached key ring."
20914,__label2__,My daughter  was thrilled to get these in November at her home.  She wore them home for Thanksgiving and really liked them.  She said they fit perfectly.
20915,__label2__,I believe these run small. I tried one on at Macy's so I knew to order a medium rather than a small. I am 5'1&#34; 105 lbs and 32A for reference. The medium fits perfectly. The bra is SO cute. I purchased in grey as well.
20916,__label2__,Love the feel of these shoes but I ordered a half size larger based on prior reviews and it's true that these run smaller than typical.
20917,__label2__,"I have worn the 180s brand for quite awhile, so I bought these to replace  an old pair. Unfortunately for me,  the polyester outer shell rubs against my scarf or coat and makes a lot of noise. If that is a concern for  you,  I would recommend the Tec Fleece or the  Chesterfield -- I think I had the chesterfield last time"
20918,__label2__,These shorts fit perfectly and feel great... And it doesn't hurt that they are pretty sexy too ;) I will definitely be buying more of these
20919,__label2__,"I loved these shoes for the first couple weeks. Then out of nowhere they started giving me blisters, not sure why."
20920,__label2__,I normally wear a 20-22 top. Due to reviews I went up 2 sizes to the 5x and it is too large but I'll make it work. Super cute. Can't wait to wear it to rockfest!! Gave four stars due to the care instructions of hand wash.
20921,__label2__,"I am always looking for wide shoes that are comfortable. I happen to be of average or even less than average weight and have wide feet. These are really cute shoes and could be very comfortable, but not for me.<br /><br />These shoes are designed for people who need wide shoes for a reason other than bone structure. The toe box fit my feet well, but there was so much room for the rest of my foot, that my foot rubbed and I ended up with four blisters. I was very disappointed. But it helped me understand why when I entered a Clarks store one time and asked for wide shoes, the clerk asked me, &#34;Why do you think you need wide shoes?&#34; I'm guessing that that is how they make their wide shoes- wide overall.<br /><br />If you are a large person though, you will be thrilled! Great cushion in the sole, cute style, cool for summer!"
20922,__label2__,"I ordered a size 5, which was way to big, so I returned the size 5 and brought a size 4, which is still somewhat big. I have to put inside support to make them work (which I hate doing).<br />I haven't worn them yet, so I do not know if they will be comfortable. But for 69.00 they should of fit perfectly....<br />Very disappointed"
20923,__label2__,Straps are short and the underwire for one bra poked through.  Not the worst but certainly won't buy these again.
20924,__label2__,Shoe fit as expected when purchased however it did not live up to my expectation.  After searching for a Cole Hann shoe that would fit with ease I am very dissatisfied as the sole has cracked with less then 6 months of wear time.  I used these shoes in a rotation with three others and did not expect them to wear out as fast as they did.  I could see if worn daily that some issues would arise but this was unexpected and am very dissatisfied.
20925,__label2__,Ray bans are good quality. I have never had problems with their glasses and this time is no different.<br /><br />I like that this style doesn't have such a thick frame all the way around the lens.<br /><br />They are extremely comfortable and most importantly keep the sun out of your eyes.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable considering the quality of glasses you are getting.
20926,__label2__,My son is almost five and a medium was about a size to big but will eventually fit. I havent washed it yet though
20927,__label2__,Fit into the boot no problem.  Comfortable from the beginning.  Nice extra support.  2nd time purchase.  Cost... a little pricey.
20928,__label2__,"I usually love Nine West bags, but this one just isn't doing it for me. While there are two side pockets on the inside of the bag, they are barely big enough to hold anything.  AND if you have a slightly thicker wallet in the middle compartment, the magnetic tab at the top will not stay closed."
20929,__label2__,Felt costume and otherwise a good match for the Fred costume. Beware: there is no wig. The hairpiece is a printed piece of foam!!
20930,__label2__,"I've been wearing this style of Lee Jeans to work for a very long time.  They are very durable, comfortable, and do not need replacing too often"
20931,__label2__,"We had a great time at a 40's Bugle Boy party. Costume fit great, was cute, sexy, and practical. Plan to wear it again."
20932,__label2__,It was a little big but that's because it was my fault on the size. He loved it other wise. I even ordered more yesterday but on size smaller.  Thanks
20933,__label2__,"This is a very pretty shirt.  The lace is pretty, not too stiff, but not delicate.  The style is very flattering.  I purchased this to have a dressy shirt for the holidays.  I ordered an XXL  based on the sizing chart.  Normally I am an XL.  The XXL fits snugly."
20934,__label2__,I had a pair of Spiras before replacing it with this pair and the new pair sized out to large but wearable. It's a great looking pair &#34;Air Force&#34; colors that I love. My feet tend to slide on cushion and they make my ankle feel like I'm going to twist it.  It's not stable like my old pair.
20935,__label2__,Too small.  I have worn the same size for 50 years.  Don't know why these were so short. Very comfortable as long as I didn't walk in them.
20936,__label2__,I'm really disappointed...  I got the dress fairly quickly... went to try it on and the zipper broke on my husband's hands. It was not to small. If anything it was a little loose... now on top of $60 I have to take it in to be fixed!!!
20937,__label2__,"For some reason, my girlfriend wanted comfy socks with traction on the bottom for Christmas. Hospital socks! She loves them and wears them often. It's weird. But that's ok."
20938,__label2__,"excellent, lo voy a recomendar a toda mi familia, productos de altisima calidad, muy responsables en todo, no tengo queja alguna!!!!"
20939,__label2__,"To Green, not like picture at all ...<br />Fabric was great with lots of give.,<br />But again that color is nothing like the picture.. Had to return.."
20940,__label2__,Very comfortable sandals that have lasted through the season and provide a welcome bottle opener.  Will buy another pair when they wear out.
20941,__label2__,"I am a small person (5'0) and I wanted it to be oversized on me. And when I got the shirt, it was exactly what I was hoping for."
20942,__label2__,"These were a Christmas present for my wife this year and they are already a big hit. Quote: &#34;They are wonderful&#34;. We both love the look of these slippers, pretty and &#34;classy&#34;. They are a replacement for a previous pair of Acorn slippers that I bought her several years ago and that she had worn completely out. These are better looking, and manifest the same quality found in her previous pair. In agreement with some other reviews:<br /><br />(1) My wife has already remarked that she doesn't need socks with these; they are so warm, soft, and snuggly.<br /><br />(2) Forewarned by other reviews, I moved up in size a step to a &#34;Large&#34; and these fit my size 7.5 wife's feet perfectly.<br /><br />Our experience with Acorn slippers is that while they are a bit &#34;pricey&#34;, they more than return the investment in appearance, comfort and life."
20943,__label2__,"Perfect shoes, did not like the colour so gave them to a grateful recipient , Will be on line ordering again in a different colour later this week , ALEA GADDAFI LOVES THESE"
20944,__label2__,"I am on my third pair of crocs filp flops and they have proved their quality, comfort and durability. I have used them all over the world. Chilling on a beach or walking throught a european city. I never travel without them."
20945,__label2__,"I'm glad Teva still produces these. Along with Crocs, Crocband Flip, the best flip flops for the price out there. The foot bed grips your foot well and they don't slip on your feet. Some have commented about the strap being too tight, but I personally like a tight strap on my flops. I had a pair of Sanuk flops and the strap was so loose I kept turning my ankle in them thus I got rid of them.  I would definitely recommend these."
20946,__label2__,Super soft and fits like a dream.  My post preggo achy feet are in heaven.  The bows up the back make the plain black boot much more pretty and eye catching.
20947,__label2__,"Wife likes them, no complaints. Crystal on the straps looks good, good price and these are hard to find in stores. Size true to chart."
20948,__label2__,"No fooling anybody here, definitely faux. Cute for sure. Order one size larger than your current shoe size or 1/2 size larger if you think it might stretch...1/2 size was still too tight for me but I also have a wider foot....Oh yeah did i mention that you have to pay for postage to return them.... paid 10.00 to receive them and 8.50 to return them and they credited me the price of the shoe 38.99! I lost 18.50 on that transaction.  come on La Bella give some customer courtesy especially since you are getting so many returns on this one..."
20949,__label2__,"Shoes are little heavy on my feet, a lighter version will be better. They are better than some brands I have been using. I don't mind buying them again for another color."
20950,__label2__,I got the flat shoes at my door at 5pm and went to the mall for couple hours. When I came back home the sole was demaged like I wear for a couple months and walked on the rocks.<br />Its not confortable also.<br />Did not worth $40!!!
20951,__label2__,I love these shoes even though they are wide for me and did not have in narrow so I had to return.  So sad!!!!
20952,__label2__,"Large enough for pre-printed checks, probably will use a slim pen for the sewn in slot. Thin plastic carbon sleeve,that she doesn't need. Get an aftermarket carbon sleeve that folds from the side if you need it."
20953,__label2__,"While beautifully made, who wants a noisy slipper?  This style would be perfect with a suede outer sole.  This shoe is for someone who needs slip-on outside shoes and a pair of quiet slippers for inside the house."
20954,__label2__,"These sandals looked better in their picture. They are too big and after wearing only 1 time, they are already falling apart. They are not put together well - cheap materials. However, I like the gladiator look and will wear them unitl they fall apart totally."
20955,__label2__,I love the style so went to the mall to try on and test the other reviews.  Even when I went up a full size the toes still pinched.  Tried hard to convince myself I could live w/ it because they look so nice and are a good value.  In the end I walked away and am sure they would have ended up in the closet w/ other stuff that doesn't quite fit right.  Too too bad!
20956,__label2__,"sizes run small-order one size larger than normal, otherwise nice little lightweight summer boot. decent value for your money spent"
20957,__label2__,"Comfortable, supportive, great walking shoes for and every day shoes. I can wear them without socks. I love them and will buy another pair."
20958,__label2__,"foot bed is fine,,, it is the straps... I have ordered 4 different styles and all the straps are way to big.  Please fix this"
20959,__label2__,"These have been my go to shoes for Mud Runs (aka Obstacle Course Races) for the past 2 years as I'm still using the same pair and I probably do about 10-12 OCR's a year. These shoes are liking having 4WD for your feet when ascending and descending, steep, slippery, muddy slopes which is exactly what they've been bred for. I like them better than my Salomon SpeedCross 3's for OCR's because of the Fellraisers lower drop and more stable base. For regular trail races, I prefer my SpeedCross 3's. I can't recommend these enough if you are planning to use them for Mud Runs. If you're just looking to run gravel and relatively smooth, non-tehcnical trails, you may want to look at a shoe that may provide a bit more comfort as the ultra aggressive lugs on the Fell Raiser don't necessarily lend the shoe to the softest of feels, but they are still adequately cushioned."
20960,__label2__,Very sleek shoe and is comfortable. Fits true to size. I wore them with a thin sock and my big toe hurt after a few hours but without socks they are fine.
20961,__label2__,"the bag is not same as the picture, nothing is written in the circle or any logo<br />also its Made in china."
20962,__label2__,"I love these boots, easy to put on, easy to remove, not too warm. They fit great! I have problems with my feet, and shoes are always too tight.. but these are perfect!! LOve LOVE LOVE"
20963,__label2__,"Its easy to overlook these sunglasses nowadays but hey, there's a reason everyone has them! First off, I ordered these at 4 PM on Friday and they showed up at 11 AM Saturday morning! Amazon is awesome, if its available through Amazon I choose to order through Amazon for easier returns, etc. and still only $83 + $3 shipping upgrade! Way better than going into a sunglass store, but still Ray-Ban.<br />On the glasses themselves: They do fit a little snug, perhaps its the size I ordered but they don't squeeze my head or bother me at all so I'm fine. They're heavy-weight, quality glasses. You can tell they're Ray-Ban and they're worth the money. Holding and wearing these makes you realize that cheap sunglasses don't always cut it, unless you're at the amusement park. Definitely worth the money! They suit most people and faces really well. The slant is noticeable but doesn't look bad. Love my Ray-Bans"
20964,__label2__,This is my sons second pair!  The eyes fell out of the last minion shoes and he was upset - we found them here and he is really excited to have a fresh pair!
20965,__label2__,"My foot is so wide! When trying on shoes I would always have a hard time putting my foot in, but with these I had no problem. They are great! Get them!"
20966,__label2__,I read the reviews and bought a 51/2 instead of the 6 I have been wearing for over 20 years. Unfortunatly they were too small and now I have to send them to Great Britian. Was kind of shocked since the company us shoes usa. I am sure in the fine print somewhere its says if you return these shoes thats international to all USA. Lesson learned. :(
20967,__label2__,These are so manish looking I sent them back. I was hoping for a black sneaker that looked more feminine. Sorry. I still haven't found anything!!!
20968,__label2__,Great pair of shoes at a great price! Very comfortable and fit true to size. I highly recommend them. At $78 a pair they are a steal!
20969,__label2__,"I am flat footed and I had to go out and get some Dr Scholls inserts, but I am overall pleaded with the shoes."
20970,__label2__,We are on our third pair in less than 2 months!  The first set the strap started to fall apart within 2 weeks.  I called Stride Rite to complain and they sent me a new pair which had a wire not stitched right so it was hanging out of the shoe.  I took those back to the store and was given a new pair and they were fine but now after only about a month the lights are going out already!!  My son loves them and was crying he was so upset but I won't be wasting my money on these again.
20971,__label2__,"This was a christmas gift i bought myself from my fiance.<br />When i first put them on i was a little disappointed because they didn't seem to fit right. Then after tightening the laces it looked much better. It's probably one of the best features that you can decide how tight or loose you want the boot to fit. I have large calves so this is a major bonus. .<br />I'm still waiting for the leather to soften up a bit, as it's a little stiff. But i still love them!"
20972,__label2__,Love these clip-ons.  They look better than the ones I bought with my prescription glasses but then lost. I get lots of compliments on them.
20973,__label2__,"These are great slippers, very soft.  The tag does state that they should fit snuggly.  At first they seemed very small for the size I ordered, but I wear them barefoot and they work.  However, I can't wear them with socks as they feel to small.  I think the next pair I order I would order the next size.  It would be helpful to have this information in the description when selecting, before purchase."
20974,__label2__,"It is a light, very comfortable boot, very cheap and a great value for money. It can be easily used as an every day winter shoe because it is warm. BUT it is not a heavy duty hiking waterproof boot."
20975,__label2__,"This is the second pair of these for my daughter, who just turned two. In other shoes she is wearing a size 7, but in these she is wearing a 6. Amazon's exchange policy made the switch suuuuuper easy, but I wish I knew the sizing was off before I ordered in the first place. These will fit tight when they arrive, as they are meant to stretch and conform to your foot. After weeks of wear, these still look great. My favorite feature of these is that they are meant to get wet and stretch, whereas other leather shoes I am afraid of doing so. Literally take these to the beach to play in the sand and they will come out just as they went in!<br /><br />**Side note: I also wear these. The sizing is kinda the opposite for adults though. I am typically a 9.5 and I wear a size 10. Hope that helps!"
20976,__label2__,"Cheaply made ofmilght weight plastics. but for the price I should not complain. It should last one season andnthe sole should be crushed. If you want something to last, spend more money."
20977,__label2__,"I bought these for my daughter for gym class, and she absolutely loves them.  She says they are the most comfortable shoes she's ever worn."
20978,__label2__,"Love them, although they are 'ugly, cute' shoes. So far the deerskin insoles provide great comfort, although there is something dark from the back of the shoe that has rubbed off on my feet.  Hopefully after wearing them a few times this will stop."
20979,__label2__,"Good price, guess this is the reason for the strong smell of the shoes. I have them a few weeks now, finally it starts to fade a little..."
20980,__label2__,"I have been looking for a Cosmetic bag, and I've never bought Vera Bradley before and I'm so very please!"
20981,__label2__,"These are literally my second favorite shoes. (Second only to my Nike flip-flops!). They are so comfy. I have noticed a little bunching, getting a little slouchy around the ankles, but I think that may be because of my larger than average calves and regular ankles. BY the way, the normal size fits my muscular calves quite well. I wear a size 10 and size 10 fits perfectly. Would definitely buy Dr. Scholl's boots again."
20982,__label2__,"Got these just in time to hike on snow-covered gravel road. They were warm and had great traction. Best of all, they are quick and easy to lace up- just wind them around the hooks and off you go. I sometimes wear a 9 1/2, but mainly a 10. I got the 10 and they fit great. There was no break-in needed- my feet felt fine after their first workout."
20983,__label2__,"These run I would say two sizes smaller than what they are. Not true to size at all. My daughter is always a 9 and I ordered one size up and it was still a VERY tight fit. Good thing they are only for one outfit to have pictures taken in, because she said they are made so poorly they event hurt to walk in. &#34;Look&#34; okay, fit and wearing them are a different story. But you do get what you pay for and they are cheap and cheaply made. For a one occasion shoe, no big deal I guess."
20984,__label2__,I absolutely love these boots. I have large calves and always have a hard time finding boots to fit. I bought the &#34;wide calf&#34; size and they fit great. They are very warm and very comfortable!! I walked around a city for 2 days over the holidays wearing them...no blisters at all AND my feet stayed warm!! Highly recommended!
20985,__label2__,"This is my second pair, great price, adorable glasses. I get compliments all the time. I'll be ordering more, maybe in all the colors."
20986,__label2__,"These shoes are absolutely adorable! But I have to say, I gave it a 3-star because they KILL my feet! And they make me stand at an angle like I am about to tumble forward. If you can deal with sore feet and like cute shoes, these are for you."
20987,__label2__,Great for walking long distances or at work during the day.  I like that both blue and gray shoelaces were included. Quite comfortable.
20988,__label2__,"It's tough to find a good pair of sunglasses. After going years with cheap $20 pairs, I decided to look for a good upgrade and spend a bit extra. Well, this pair is near flawless. Great design - a lens that's large enough to not bother your peripheral vision, yet not too large to cover up your face. The sides are thick, so you get a bit of privacy from people viewing you from the side (i.e. when you take a nap on the bus.) Also, something to note is the way it sits on your face, obviously there are different shaped faces, but for me, the glasses sit far enough away so it doesn't press on your cheeks when you move your mouth or smile. The contact points are the sides of the ear and bridge of the nose - perfect. They also have a nice green tint to them, very subtle and providing a good amount of shading. They're also polarized, which adds to the cost, but increases the benefit. They also come with a large case, a little minus because it's so large, but they're specifically made for these so they won't get bent or crushed. Give these a try, I think you'll be quite happy you did."
20989,__label2__,Revived a pair of Birkenstock Londons that I'd given up for lost. Now they look almost new. The shoe cream goes on evenly and does not look shiny or waxy.
20990,__label2__,"Its the most comfortable shoe I never had before!<br /><br />Absolutely loved it, comfortable shoe and better price. What else I would want?"
20991,__label2__,These shoes are absolutely amazing. They are the most comfortable work shoes I have purchased in a long time.
20992,__label2__,"These boots are an AMAZING alternative to the SW 5050 boot.  I ordered both, and frankly I prefer this one. The quality is just as good and the price is better, another imporatant factor for me personally is the calf circum. My calfs are only 12 inches, so these boots fit better then the SW 5050 boots, which have a 14 in circum.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving these boots five stars is that even with jeans and boot socks, these boots are still slightly loose on me. I really wish there was a narrow calf option with an 11 or 12 inch circum. so that I could get a more fitted look.<br /><br />I highly recommend these boots! I can't wait to wear them! Just be mindful if you have very skinny legs that these will be slighly loose."
20993,__label2__,"My son had ordered it but when it arrived, he instantly hated it. In the pictures it looks quite different from what it actually looks."
20994,__label2__,"These shoes fit well.  I purchased to wear to work in the rain.  The back of the shoe is a little lower on the heal that I like.  However, all in all they are a nice shoe."
20995,__label2__,"These slippers are soft, warm, and very cozy.  I wear a size 8B and the 7.5/8 size fits me perfectly."
20996,__label2__,"I bought these for work.  I have high arches, so I use an arch support.  The heels are not too high."
20997,__label2__,Crocs are one of only two brands of shoes that I can be on my feet all day at work! Love cross unisex classic clog!
20998,__label2__,"I love moccasins  This fit like it was custom made for me.<br />Very soft and comfortable.  Double leather bottom so I will wear it everywhere except when walking on street or side walk, because I dont want to wear it down, It also has an inner sole pad. Did I mention that it is very comfortable?"
20999,__label2__,I wish these were a little more durable. I got it caught on a bolt crossing the bunk feeding calves. Ripped a big hole no problem on the of the color part of the boot.  I broke these boots in barefooted they rock I love them. Got another pair for good. They need to make these in purple😊
21000,__label2__,"I've been looking for a replacement for my beloved KSO treks (owned two since I found them), and I was also looking for a water-resistant toe shoe to ride in the rain and walk in puddles.  These looked like they would work and aside from an initial mistake in sizing (advice elsewhere said they ran small, but the one I ordered first was way too big, so I reordered my regular and they fit), I love them.  Still miss the KSO trek's soft leather feel (especially the sole), but these will do.  The laces are a pain, and they do come undone sometimes, and the heel chafed at first so I had to wear bandaids until I toughened up, but I think these will have to be my KSO Trek replacements for now until Vibram reissues them (please oh  please!)."
