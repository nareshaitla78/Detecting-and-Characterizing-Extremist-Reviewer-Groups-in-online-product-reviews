The tech armor I phone 5 anti glare and anti fingerprint iphone 5 cover fits very good and works great
When least you think so, this product will save the day. Just keep it around just in case you need it for something
I have purchased about 3 of this items so far and I am still loving it like its the first time buying
Unfortunately they didn't work for me. They made me sick and throw up once of the two times I tried them
I love the looks of the phone case but the buttons were difficult to press.  I tossed it out after one week of struggling with it
This kettle is a gift for my daughter. She said that it is easy to use. She likes the design of it, so nice and neat.
the glasses are very small, and i would like that you can sell just one pair of glasses, because for are to much
Love the colors and the feel of the hard case.  Excellent coverage for the iPhone to protect it when dropped
I have had my camera for about 2 weeks now. The pictures are great, it is so easy to use. I love it!!
